Get features likeThe Delhi Police on Saturday registered an FIR against 'The Wire' after BJP's IT-cell head Amit Malviya registered a complaint alleging that the media company “forged documents with a view to malign and tarnish"" his reputation.The Wire, its founder Siddharth Varadarajan, its founder editors Sidharth Bhatia and MK Venu and its deputy editor and executive news producer Jahnavi Sen have been named in the FIR which has been registered under Sections 420, 468, 469, 471, 500 r/w 120B and 34 IPC, news agency ANI reported.The matter pertains to Meta stories which were ""retracted"" by the news website. It retracted the stories after Meta and various other experts pointed out critical flaws in their reporting.Malviya has alleged that on October 6, 2022, The Wire had published a report claiming that Meta (the parent company that owns Facebook and Instagram) had removed an Instagram post within a few minutes of it being uploaded by a private account namely ""Cringearchivist"". The report claimed that the company regularly colludes with members of the BJP in removing content deemed unfavourable to the party.He further alleged that on October 10 the news portal went on to claim that “I was the nodal point, interfacing between the party and Meta, for said censorship activity, having been bestowed certain 'XCheck' and other privileges by the company”.""As per the report, this status had bestowed on me the following powers overriding any filters, algorithms, vetting, verification or any other checks and balances within the company,"" Malviya said in a statement.The BJP leader also alleged that the report went on to cite alleged internal correspondence of Meta to justify its claims, alleging had used said privileges to take down a total of 705 posts to date.""On October 11, 2022, Meta's Communication Head, Andy Stone, issued a categorical denial and stated that the documents presented by 'The Wire' in its report were fabricated' and that the ‘Xcheck’ status had been mischaracterized. Once Meta issued this statement, 'The Wire' should have at the very least paused its coverage of this issue and commenced an internal audit. Instead, on the same day, it went on to publish yet another malicious report claiming to have accessed further internal emails of Meta employees, namely those exchanged between Andy Stone and his team, purportedly trying to effect a coverup,"" he said.He stated that The Wire publicly apologised to its readers on October 27 and retracted the stories about ""XCheck"" and Meta after scathing public scrutiny and the exposure of significant fabrication of dates, times and content in its alleged ""proof"".""However, even while retracting the story, The Wire' refrained from apologising to me, despite maligning and tarnishing my reputation and causing serious harm to my professional career. My role requires me to vociferously advocate the BJP's point of view on national issues, across platforms,"" he said.""This role is based on trust and camaraderie, between me and my interlocutors across platforms and more importantly with the public. However, The Wire's stories have vitiated the atmosphere and severely dented relationships and trust built over the years for me to carry out the functions of my responsibility,"" the BJP leader added.Stating that The Wire and some unknown persons entered into a ""criminal conspiracy"" with the intent to ""malign and tarnish"" his reputation, he said that the news portal ""deliberately"" inserted his name into a story, and ""fabricated"" evidence to ""implicate"" him.""Consequently, I am left with no option other than to seek appropriate legal remedies against The Wire and its management/reporters. As mentioned yesterday, will lodge an FIR with the concerned police station under sections that deal with forgery, forgery for the purposes of cheating, forgery to harm reputation, defamation, cheating and criminal conspiracy among others. Additionally, I will also initiate appropriate civil action for damages against The Wire and its associates,"" Malviya added.Last week, The Wire formally retracted its Meta stories “after conducting an internal review of the technical source material used, with the help of external experts”.Meta is the parent firm of Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook.The Wire said it is also conducting a comprehensive editorial review of the internal editorial processes ""which resulted in the publication of these stories in order to identify and plug any and all shortcomings"".(With inputs from agencies)Have 11 years' experience in print and digital media.

Get features likeSince Pakistan faced a shock defeat to Zimbabwe in the T20 World Cup on Thursday, the fans and former cricketers have been immensely critical of the side. The Babar Azam-led side had already lost against India in its opening game of the World Cup, and failed to chase down a 130-run target against Zimbabwe in its second match of the tournament. Moreover, Babar Azam's statement in the post-match presentation didn't sit well with a number of former cricketers, including ex-captain Salman Butt.The former Pakistan skipper, in his YouTube video, lashed out at Babar after the captain seemingly indicated that Zimbabwe had scored 10 more runs than expected on the wicket.Also read: 'Ramiz Raja should resign immediately; Babar is top batter but what's his contribution?': Ex-PAK cricketer's fiery rantReacting to the comment, Butt said, “Kal se, I haven't thought beyond the statement jo hamaare kaptaan ne, hamaare best player ne, duniya ke top player ne baat ki thi, ki 10 run zyada the. Yaar 130 me bhi 10 zyada the? Ye kya statement hai? 130 bhi bada lag raha hai score? (I couldn't move on from the statement from our captain, our best player yesterday. He said that they scored 10 runs more. Are you saying that even in 130 runs, they scored 10 extra? What was this statement?),” Butt asked furiously.In fact, Butt didn't even mince his words on his video caption. As the session also included Pakistan pacer Wahab Riaz, the video was titled, “Salman and Wahab on Babar's ‘Foolish’ Statement | Zimbabwe Loss.”Butt went on to take a dig at Babar over the statement. “Kya kare bowler? Doosri team ke balley gaayab kar lein? Kya karein? Kaise zyada tha score. Ye baat unhone presentation me kahi hai. (What can the bowler do? Do they start hiding opposition players' bats? How was this score big? He said this in presentation!),” Butt further stated.The opening duo of Babar (4) and Mohammad Rizwan (14) had failed to step up in the run-chase against Zimbabwe and no batter barring Shan Masood (44) could make a mark, as Pakistan fell short by a run. The loss – again – exposed Pakistan's middle-order weakness, that has been one of the primary concerns among many of the side's former cricketers in the lead-up to the tournament.Pakistan will return to action on Sunday later this week when the side takes on Netherlands in Perth.At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

When asked about her thoughts on Bollywood films not working at the box office, compared with films from the South film industry, Kangana told Aaj Tak, “There are various kinds of analysis about films’ performance. If you look at hit films, all of them have Indian roots. Look at Kantara. These films show India on a micro level, based on devotion and spirituality. Ponniyin Selvan-1 is also about Cholas.”“Bollywood has gone far away from its Indian culture and they have westernised films. With the trend to make westernised films, I think people are unable to relate themselves to the film. Meri bhi iss saal ek film nahin chali hain.

Despite restricting the men in maroon to a paltry score of 130/8, Pakistan failed to chase down the target as they fell short by one run.Justifiably, the Pakistan cricket fraternity is left disappointed with the side's performance in the tournament so far. While many believe that many of the Pakistan batters lack game-awareness, the side's senior wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal made a massive remark on Babar Azam after the losses. Akmal, who is also Babar's cousin, requested the star batter to “step down” from the leadership role for the betterment of his career.Also read: 'Most complete Indian batsman of my time': Australia's Greg Chappell reserves ultimate praise for star batter amid WC“Dekhein, ye toh nazar aa raha tha.

Being an elder brother, agar Babar samajhta hai, agar PCB samajhta hai meri rai, Babar ko iss World Cup ke baad kaptaani nahi karni chahiye. (See, we can see that. If we had played the same bowling attack in the first match, we wouldn't have let India chase the target. I've been saying this since the England series, but no one listens to ex-cricketers. Being an elder brother, I want to say to Babar that he should leave the captaincy after the T20 World Cup),” Akmal said on ARY News.“Agar aapko uss se 22-25000 run karwaane hain, toh usko as a player khilaayein. Varna vo itna under-pressure aayega, agar Babar ya mere chachu samajhte hain, usko step down kar dena chahiye. (If you want 22-25,000 runs from him, you have to keep him purely as a player or else he would be under-pressure. If Babar or his father understand this, he should step down).”Akmal further urged Babar to focus on his game “like Virat Kohli,” adding that the Pakistan batter not realising his full potential would be a “great loss” for the side.“Apni cricket me focus karein, jaise Virat Kohli focus karta hai. Kyunki iske baad koi batsman mere ko nazar nahi aa raha hai. Bada nuksaan hoga Pakistan cricket ka agar ye jaldi team se chala gaya toh. (He should focus on his cricket like Virat Kohli.

However, their opponents are a strong South African team who like India are yet to lose a match in this tournament. While India won both the matches they have played thus far, South Africa have one won and was almost in line to winning the other as well if it wasn't for the fact that rain forced the match to be abandoned.India's two wins thus far came on the back of some sensational knocks from their batters, with former captain Virat Kohli scoring back to back half centuries and remaining unbeaten. Former New Zealand fast bowler and commentator Danny Morrison, however, feels that South Africa's star-studded pace attack could prove to be a real challenge for the Indian batters.“Rohit (Sharma), KL (Rahul) is yet to really kick off, Suryakumar Yadav and of course, Virat Kohli. You put them up against (Kagiso) Rabada, (Anrich) Nortje, (Wayne) Parnell is making a bit of a comeback, (Keshav) Maharaj, (Tabraiz) Shamsi; South Africa have got a good bowling lineup to take on India. It is a hard one to pick. India probably get the nod given what has happened recently. But that man, South African side, look out,” said Morrison in a video for the tournament's website.“Nortje, Rabada have pace. Parnell brings in variety. Then you bring out the swing kings - Bhuvi and Shami. I like that but I just wonder about the intimidation of the South Africans. If they get it right, I am going a little bit for their bowling vs India's batting,” he said.South Africa also have a strong batting lineup, being the only team in the Super 12 stage to have scored more than 200 runs in a match. They scored 205/5 in their last match against Bangladesh, winning the game by a whopping 104 runs. Before that, they had restricted Zimbabwe to 79/5 in their nine-over innings of a rain-affected match. They had smashed their way to 51/0 in three overs before rain caused the match to be abandoned.At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

Kohli ended the game unbeaten on 82 off 53 balls.Pakistan's stunning loss to Zimbabwe came next. Zimbabwe managed to get a low total of 130/8 on board but their bowlers ensured that the going would be extremely difficult for Pakistan. Star all-rounder Sikandar Raza had led the way with three wickets and he also effected the run out off the final ball that kept Pakistan down to 129/8. Zimbabwe won by a run and are suddenly in a better position to sneak through to the semi-finals.The other matches featured in the list are from the first round, with Ireland's sensational chase against Scotland being third on it. UAE's valiant efforts to defend a target of 112 against the Netherlands came next and the list is squared off by Namibia's heart-breaking defeat to the UAE that confirmed that they won't make it to the Super 12.At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

"Mindful use of smartphones, without reducing screen time can boost productivity",https://www.hindustantimes.com//lifestyle/health/mindful-use-of-smartphones-without-reducing-screen-time-can-boost-productivity-101667054187416.html,"According to new research mindful cellphone usage, leads to higher perceived productivity and user satisfaction.Subscribe Now! Get features likeNew research shows that mindful use of smartphones, without minimizing screen time, enhances productivity.According to research recently published by Kaveh Abhari of San Diego State University and Isaac Vaghefi of City University of New York, using existing smartphone applications to monitor cellphone screen time can enhance focused or mindful cellphone usage, which, in turn, leads to higher perceived productivity and user satisfaction. The research was recently published in AIS Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction (THCI). (Also read: Excessive screen time on devices is linked with psychological issues and obesity )Abhari (associate professor of management information systems at SDSU's Fowler College of Business) and Vaghefi (assistant professor of information systems at the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College) said while there was substantial research establishing the negative effects of cellphone screen time (intolerance, withdrawal, and conflict with job-related tasks), their research was designed to determine if self-regulatory behaviors could lead to modified user behavior for more positive outcomes.""We theorized that individuals who tracked their cellphone usage and set goals surrounding that usage tended to have enhanced productivity and contentment with their productivity as they met their stated objectives,"" said Abhari. ""Previous research has shown that goal setting tends to raise performance expectations and we wanted to see if this theory held true for smartphone screen time as well.""To make this determination, the researchers surveyed 469 participating university undergraduate students in California, New York, and Hawaii. The three-week survey required all participants to complete four questionnaires and about half of them were required to download a screen-monitoring application to their phones. This app allowed users to monitor and set limits or goals with their cellphone screen time.When the results were analyzed, researchers measured the perceived productivity of screen time reported by those surveyed, as well as the amount of screen time and the fatigue associated with self-monitoring. They also reviewed participants' contentment with their productivity achieved through cellphone screen time. ""Self-monitoring appears necessary to encourage the optimized use of smartphones,"" said Abhari. ""The results suggest that optimizing but not minimizing screen time is more likely to increase user productivity.""However, the researchers also found that self-monitoring induces fatigue and weakens the effect on productivity, though it was not a significant factor affecting the relationship between self-monitoring and contentment with productivity achievement.In conclusion, Abhari and Vaghefi determined that while uncontrolled cellphone use (or cellphone addiction) could negatively impact people's lives, monitored screen time particularly monitored screen time with specific goals in mind can result in positive outcomes and higher overall user satisfaction. ""This study could lead system developers to embed features into mobile devices that enable self-monitoring,"" said Abhari. ""These features could improve quality screen time and enhance the relationship between humans and digital technology.""Follow more stories on Facebook & TwitterPersonalise your news feed.

This group of diseases is usually treated with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs,"" Dr Agarwal saysDr Menon says if the causes are viral infections, it is usually self-limiting; if it is due to drugs, it resolves once the medication is stopped but the commonest cause is autoimmune, where there are antibodies in the body which target the muscle cells causing inflammation which translates into pain, soreness and weakness.""Myositis caused due to viral infections is typically diagnosed by blood tests including CBC, ESR, CRP and CPK which is a muscle enzyme which rises dramatically when there is a myositis. Diagnosis maybe sometimes confirmed by an EMG which is a nerve muscle study and a muscle biopsy. The treatment, if autoimmune typically needs steroids or immunosuppressants.

While some of the major French and British museums interviewed by AFP, including the Louvre, the National Gallery and the Tate in London, are keeping a low profile on the issue, others are calling for stronger protective measures against such acts.""Art is defenceless and we strongly condemn trying to damage it for whichever cause,"" the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague said in a statement.It was in the Mauritshuis that Johannes Vermeer's masterpiece ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" was targeted by climate activists this week.Two activists glued themselves to the painting and adjoining wall, while another threw a thick red substance, but the artwork was behind glass and undamaged, and returned to public view on Friday.Social media images showed the activists wearing ""Just Stop Oil"" T-shirts.""How do you feel?"" one of them asked. ""This painting is protected by glass but... the future of our children is not protected.""That attack came after environmental activists splashed tomato soup on Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" at the National Gallery in London, and threw mashed potato over a Claude Monet painting at the Barberini Museum in Potsdam, Germany.Bernard Blistene, honorary president of the modern art Centre Pompidou in Paris, said all museum managers had been taking precautions against vandalism for a very long time.""Should we take more? No doubt,"" he said.- Ban on bags? -Ortrud Westheider, director of the Barberini Museum, said the recent attacks showed ""international security standards for the protection of artworks in case of activist attacks are not sufficient"".Eco-militants from the Last Generation group hurled mashed potato onto Monet's ""Les Meules"" (Haystacks) at the museum.The group later published a video on social media, writing: ""If it takes a painting -- with #MashedPotatoes or #TomatoSoup thrown at it -- to make society remember that the fossil fuel course is killing us all: Then we'll give you #MashedPotatoes on a painting!""The museum said the painting was protected by glass and had not suffered damage.In a similar stunt on October 14, two environmental protesters hit van Gogh's world-renowned work with tomato soup in London. The gallery said the protesters caused ""minor damage"" to the frame but the painting was ""unharmed"".Remigiusz Plath, security expert for the German museums association DMB and the Hasso Plattner Foundation, said the string of art attacks was ""clearly a kind of escalation process"".""There are different ways of reacting and of course all museums have to think about extended security measures -- measures that were previously very unusual for museums in Germany and in Europe, that were perhaps only known in the US,"" he said.Such measures could include a complete ban on bags and jackets as well as security searches.""The environmental catastrophe and the climate crisis are of course also a matter of concern to us... But we have absolutely no tolerance for vandalism,"" he added.The Prado museum in the Spanish capital has said it was ""on alert"".At the Queen Sofia museum in Madrid, conservation expert Jorge Garcia Gomez-Tejedo told Spanish media this week, only the most vulnerable works are displayed behind armoured glass.- 'Nihilism' -Adam Weinberg, of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, has questioned the activists' approach.""It's people putting themselves on a stage in order to bring attention to something, but you have to ask, does this really change anything?"" he said at a discussion on Wednesday in Qatar, according to ARTNews.Tristram Hunt, of London's Victoria and Albert Museum, voiced concern at the ""nihilistic language around the protests that there is no place for art in times of crisis"".""I don't agree,"" he said at the same event.France's Culture minister Rima Abdul Malak has called on ""all national museums to redouble their vigilance"".""How can... defending the climate lead to wanting to destroy a work of art? It's absolutely absurd,"" she told Le Parisien daily.In May, Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" had a custard pie thrown in her face at the Louvre museum in Paris, but the artwork's thick bulletproof case ensured she came to no harm.Her attacker said he was taking aim at artists who are not focusing enough on ""the planet"".For Didier Rykner, founder of online French magazine La Tribune de l'art, these acts of protest are ""counterproductive"" and ""the more visibility they are given, the more they will do it again"".But ""by becoming commonplace, these acts undoubtedly lose their force,"" he argued.Personalise your news feed.

Get features likePakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan on Friday drew parallels from 1970 when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman-led Awami League wasn't allowed to form the government despite winning the majority in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in the general elections.“What happened in East Pakistan? The largest party won, but they were not given the right. Instead, we took action against them,” said Khan drawing parallels between the 1971 liberation war and 2022 in Pakistan.“At the age of 18, I went to play an exhibition cricket match in Bangladesh. We won two matches against India. What surprised me was that every Bangladeshi in and outside the stadium chanted ‘Pakistan Zindabad’. That day, I realised the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan is the biggest tragedy,” Khan said in his first public remarks since the assassination attempt on him on Thursday.Khan was shot in the leg as he waved to crowds from a container mounted on a truck from where he was leading a protest march on the capital to press for early elections and calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.In erstwhile East Pakistan, a huge majority of the Bengali nation had favoured the Awami League, under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in the 1970 Pakistani general elections. The party had emerged as the largest party in the nation, gaining the exclusive mandate of Pakistan in terms both of seats and votes.The Pakistan Peoples Party failed to win any seats in East Pakistan. The Awami League's failure to win any seats in then west Pakistan was used by Zulfikar Bhutto who argued that Mujibur had received ""no mandate or support from West Pakistan"". The then leaders of Pakistan, all from West Pakistan and PPP, strongly opposed the idea of an East Pakistani-led government.Meanwhile, Khan said on Friday that he would resume his protest march to Islamabad after recovering even as his supporters staged nationwide protests that blocked major roads.He said two shooters had tried to assassinate him, in a country with a history of politically motivated violence. He said one person was killed and 11 others were injured in Thursday's attack in Wazirabad, about 170 km (106 miles) southeast of Islamabad.Khan also said the failed assassination attempt against him will push the people of Pakistan to take to the streets like in Sri Lanka.“Either we will have a peaceful revolution or a bloody one,” the former prime minister said, adding, “People will take to the streets like Sri Lanka.

He also rejected charges of interference in appointments in state’s universities levelled against him by the ruling front’s leaders. At a convention in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday, Vijayan and other LDF leaders attacked Khan alleging that he was trying to implement the agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in state universities.Also read: Man arrested in Kerala for allegedly assaulting minor boy for leaning on his carMeanwhile, activists belonging to the Students Federation of India (SFI) on Friday blocked the entry of acting vice- chancellor of APJ Abdul Kalam University Sisa Thomas, who was appointed by the Governor.

Citing the apex court order, last month, the Governor had sent show-cause notices to 11 V-Cs saying their appointments also flouted UGC norms and they were not entitled to hold their offices in view of the judgment.Initially, the government recommended the name of Digital University V-C Saj Gopinath for the post but Khan turned it down as he was among the 11 V-Cs who were served show-cause notices.Later, the government proposed the name of higher education secretary Ishita Roy, a senior IAS officer, but this was also turned down citing a lack of experience or technical prowess.Personalise your news feed.

Get features likeMumbai: In a relief to the Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association (FRTWA), the Supreme Court (SC) has directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to maintain status quo on the issue of the rule mandating shops and establishments to display their names in Marathi.The FRTWA had approached the SC after their plea challenging the BMC’s decision on making Marathi signboards in Devnagri script mandatory was rejected by the high court (HC) in February this year. The BMC decision had further stated that shopkeepers failing to comply would be fined ₹1 lakh, which was also challenged by the federation. The SC has restrained the BMC from taking any action against retailers till the petition is decided in the SC.Speaking about the development, a FRTWA member said that apart from restraining the civic authority, the SC directed the federation to furnish a list of retailers who would be covered by the interim protection.The issue pertains to the challenge by the FRTWA to rule 35 of the Maharashtra Shops and Establishment Act, which stipulated that every commercial establishment signboard had to be in Marathi language in the Devanagari script along with any other language. The petition of FRTWA was heard by the HC division bench of justice Gautam Patel and justice Madhav Jamdar on February 23, 2022.The federation had submitted that the rule 35 was contrary to the Act and hence imposition of a penalty of ₹1 lakh for non-compliance was akin to putting an individual under a disability. The federation also submitted that the adoption of Marathi language by the state was only meant for official purposes and hence individuals could not be forced to accept the same.The bench was also informed that the rule violated the constitutional right of expression by making it mandatory for every establishment of more than 10 employees to have a name board in Marathi language in Devanagari script with a font size not less than that of any other language. The federation submitted that the state could not dictate its citizens in what language a signboard must be displayed as Article 14 and 19 give an unfettered right to every citizen to be the sole judge of mode and medium of expression.However, additional government pleader Abhay Patki for the state had argued that there was no contradiction in the rule and the Act and the true intent of the petitioners was not bonafide as the rule was in existence since 2018 but the petition was filed only in 2022.After hearing the submissions, the bench had noted in its order, “We do not find substance in any of these submissions whatsoever. There is a public purpose that is sought to be achieved by rule 35 if read correctly.

Get features likeStar India batter Virat Kohli will celebrate his birthday tomorrow, i.e. – November 5. While Virat, his plethora of fans and the entire Indian team will have plans on the special day, it seems as if birthday has come early for Kohli. A day before the former India captain turns 34, birthday wishes are storming in already for Kohli as Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell dropped a heart-warming message for Kohli on live TV.After Australia's narrow four-run win over Afghanistan at the T20 World Cup, Maxwell was up for an interview with renowned sports broadcaster Neroli Meadows. It is important to note that despite Australia's semi-final hopes depending on the outcome of the England vs Sri Lanka match, Maxwell appeared in good spirits when he wished his Royal Challengers Bangalore teammate Kohli in advance.""Yeah, so tomorrow, I just want to wish a very happy birthday to one of my very good friends, Virat Kohli. Hope you have a great day. I'll send you a text anyway. Enjoy, mate,"" said Maxwell.Watch the video below:pic.twitter.com/kMQq5fgBTKKohli and Maxwell have been teammates at RCB for two seasons. Maxwell joined RCB from Punjab Kings (formerly Kings XI Punjab) in 2021 after enduring a horror season with the 2014 IPL runner-up which saw him struggle and score just 108 runs from 14 matches. The following year, Maxwell hit top gear as he amassed 511 runs from 15 games at a strike-rate of 144.10, a season where he hit six half-centuries. At the IPL mega-auction, Maxwell was retained by RCB for ₹11 crore and scored 301 runs from 13 games in IPL 2022.Back to the Afghanistan game, Maxwell was adjudged the Player of the Match for his innings of 54 not out off 32 balls which lifted Australia to 168/8. An all-rounder in the team, Maxwell did not get to bowl but took a smart catch to dismiss Najibullah Zadran.""It was nice to have an impact in the field. I knew I wasn't going to have much of an impact with the ball with the conditions they were. To have an impact is nice. During the day, it was quite slow and taking spin, it was holding up a little bit,"" he added.While Maxwell praised Afghanistan for the fight their batters showed, he knows what is at stake on Saturday as England face Sri Lanka in the final Group 1 match. An England win will see them go through and join New Zealand in the semifinals, whereas for Australia to qualify for the semis, the already knocked out Sri Lanka need to beat Jos Buttler and his team. Maxwell, who found himself in a similar situation a few months back during the IPL, said he and the Aussies will be cheering the Lankans on in the crunch game in Sydney tomorrow.""Afghanistan played really well, they struck the ball really cleanly. At the start, they put us under pressure in the powerplay. We were able to hold them back but then there was some pretty clean hitting towards the back end and gave us a bit of a scare,"" Maxwell said.""It was quite hard to press the issue. We got to about the 12th over mark where we just had to put a total on the board to make sure we gave ourselves a chance of winning the game. Even though we were trying to go hard, they (Afghanistan) bowled extremely well in the last four overs. They executed their plans and it was hard to get away. We'll be following it (England vs Sri Lanka), we put ourselves in this situation, but hopefully Sri Lanka can do the job for us.""At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

During a rapid question-answer round, she was asked to name someone from the industry with whom she hasn’t worked but thinks ‘would look good onscreen.’ To this, within a blink of an eye, Janhvi instantly replied, “Ranveer Singh.”GoodTimes also quoted Janhvi saying, “I think Ranveer Singh and me will make a great pair.” Earlier this year, Janvhi once revealed her conversation with Ranveer to Film Companion. She shared what the two talked about when Janhvi got hurt during a dance rehearsal.She once talked about receiving advice from Ranveer and said, “The thing is, I actually... I think I was speaking to Ranveer about it because I got a few scratches one day trying to do some dance and Ranveer was feeling bad about it, I was like it's okay every time I get hurt on the shoot it's a sign it's going well.

And to top it all, Virat Kohli dropped a golden reaction to it as well.Subscribe Now! Get features likeOver the last few months, Suryakumar Yadav has taken the world of cricket by putting up match-winning performances one match after the other. Suryakumar was always capable of playing stunning innings, but it was during India's tour of England back in June that SKY really came into his own when he struck a maiden T20I ton at the Oval. Although Suryakumar's knock was unable to get India over the line, he had arrived; and for the next few series, the cricketing fraternity would witness the rise of the world's best T20I batsman.Besides being the highest T20I run-getter of 2022, Suryakumar has set the ongoing T20 World Cup ablaze as well, scoring back-to-back half-centuries as India are inches away from securing a semi-final berth. With over 1200 runs from just 38 matches at an average of 40.30, Suryakumar has become a T20I sensation, and is not behind in ODIs either. Currently at the peak of his form, there is no reason why Suryakumar Yadav cannot break into the Indian Test side, which is exactly what former coach Ravi Shastri told one of the broadcasters during the World Cup.""I think he is a three-format player. I know they don't talk about him for Test cricket. Let me tell you. This guy can play Test cricket and he can surprise a few. Send him there at No. 5 and let him stir it up,"" Shastri said.Reacting to Shastri's compliments, Suryakumar, who made his India debut during the former coach's tenure, couldn't stop smiling – it was ear-to-ear. After soaking in all the wonderful things Shastri had to say about the hottest player in Indian cricket at the moment, Surya's mind harked back to early 2021, when Shastri had informed SKY that he would be playing his first match for Team India.A post shared by ICC (@icc)""I still remember. He called me up. He was sitting by the poolside before I made my debut, and he said, 'Jaa ke bindaas dena' (Go and enjoy yourself). I still remember that and I'm absolutely loving it,"" Suryakumar, who was standing next to Shastri mentioned, the video of which was uploaded on ICC's Instagram handle. In fact, turns out it wasn't just Surya who was thrilled by what Shastri had to say. Virat Kohli too showed his acceptance by liking the video.pic.twitter.com/GajQ8uqGaJThe former India head coach is affirmative in his assessment and feels that SKY should be given a chance in all three formats of the game. Suryakumar has earned the moniker of being a 360-degree player, a tag which the great AB de Villiers had made famous due to his unbelievable range and types of strokes. And given the array of shots Suryakumar puts on display, it is hard to disagree with Shastri.""He can play all three formats of the game and the reason I say that is that he is different. You don’t get too many players who can hit spots the way he does. He hits it into unusual areas he gets into unusual positions and it is literally a challenge to the bowler as to where he can bowl. His great ability is to read what length the bowler is bowling, he anticipates early and he backs himself and very few players go out with that kind of mindset,"" Shastri was quoted as saying by the ICC website.""He is lighting up this World Cup and he is playing shots which 10 years ago no one would have imagined. The way he used that pace and bounce in Perth. He sussed the conditions, and it suited his game and I think his eyes will light up every time he goes to play in Australia as there is pace, there is bounce, and he likes to use the pace and bounce. There will be a lot of youngsters wanting to emulate him. Just watching the way he moves and the areas he tries to hit...he is a proper 360 degree player. He is someone who can puncture any part of the ground.""At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

It is actually his attempt to do it, that's what qualifies as 'fake fielding.'Subscribe Now! Get features likeIs it even possible to keep the limelight and the discussions away from Virat Kohli. The answer is quite simple. No! Kohli is in the news when he is scoring heaps of runs. He is in the news when he is not. He is in the news for his unbelievable high energy in the practice session. He is again in the news when he decides to skip an optional session. He is grabbing the headlines with his brilliant fielding and he is doing the same when he is faking it. 'Fake fielding' that's the latest to keep Virat Kohli in the news. Of course, he is the current leading run-scorer of the T20 World Cup and was India's top-scorer against Bangladesh but all that seems to have slightly taken the backstage after Bangladesh keeper-batter Nurus Hasan accused him of 'fake fielding.'So what's the story? In the second ball of the 7th over of the Bangladesh chase, India pacer Arshdeep Singh collected the ball in the deep and threw towards keeper Dinesh Karthik as Bangladesh openers Litton Das and Nazmul Hasan Shanto attempted a couple. In between all this, Kohli, who had no role in the action, gestured of collecting the ball and throwing it when the ball was not even near him. Kohli's actions had no bearing on the Bangladesh pair as they completed the second run without any difficulty but according to Bangladesh and also former India opener Aakash Chopra, it doesn't matter whether the batters were deceived or not. It is actually the attempt to do it, that's what qualifies as 'fake fielding.'What does the ‘fake fielding’ rule say? cricket's law 41.5, pertaining to unfair play, says “…it is unfair for any fielder wilfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive or obstruct either batter after the striker has received the ball.”In easy words, if the umpires believe that the fielder has attempted to deceive batters by faking a dive or a throw or has made any other fielding gesture when the ball is not near him then they can slap the fielding team with five penalty runs.""The basic premise of the law is that if the on-field umpire feels that you have tried to deceive the batters (by faking a throw or a dive or any other action when the ball is not near you) now whether they have been actually deceived or not doesn't matter. It will result in five penalty runs. If that five penalty runs were given, the two that the Bangladesh pair ran, would have still have been counted, the ball would have been dead and Bangladesh would have gotten to choose who takes strike in the next ball. So the consequences are huge, the penalty for fake fielding is incredible.""Now what happened in this case? The on-field umpire didn't see. It completely went unnoticed. If no one has seen it then you can't charge it. The law says that the umpires need to notice it and judge it. Maybe the third umpire, if it's in jurisdiction, can also intervene.""Woh fake fielding tha, 100% tha, wo jo throw marne ka prayas kia wo agar umpire dekhte toh 5 run ki pentaly padti humko aur 5 run se hum match bhi jeete. (Yes that 100% fake fielding because of the way he attempted to throw the ball. If the umpires had seen it then we would've been slapped with a five-run penalty and we've won by five runs only.) So we escaped here but next time if someone does this then the umpires will have to be more careful. So are Bangladesh right? Yes, they are but nobody noticed it then so can't do anything now,"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel.At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

Every year, with the onset of the winter season, the toxic smog surrounds the capital and the NCR region which is replete with carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and other matter. The government has already issued notice for schools to close and for fifty percent employee attendance in government offices as steps for the air pollution. The pollution has several levels of affecting the human body. While some show impact in short term, some take long years to show up, and impact the body adversely. Children are affected more adversely on a daily basis, as they breathe in the toxic air. “Particles of a diameter of 10 microns or less are included in the PM10 measurement, which is typically used to assess the quality of the air. Due to their capacity to enter the lower parts of the respiratory system, these particles are thought to be the cause of harmful health effects,” said Dr. Ashutosh Niranjan M.B.B.S, M.S.

Hence, they become prone to more infections and more immunity-related issues as they grow up.Dr Ashutosh Niranjan added, “Early learning, attention, and memory are significantly impacted because pollution has a negative impact on a child's health in those early years.

On Friday afternoon, the AQI at the city’s ITI Jahangirpuri station was in the “hazardous” category. Experts suggest avoiding outdoor exertion when the air quality drops to this level.The Delhi LG - in his letter - said that “people of Delhi are suffering for no fault of theirs” as he urged the Punjab Chief Minister to take urgent steps to control stubble burning. “It is sad that volume of Parali fires (farm fires) in Punjab has increased since 2021,” he wrote in a tweet, as he insisted that farmers should be made “willing partners in defeating the deadly pollution in Delhi-NCR.”Between October 24 and November 2, the Lieutenant Governor said, Punjab saw a 19 per cent surge in farm fires. Of 3,825 cases reported from six states, 3,634 cases were reported from Punjab alone, the Delhi LG pointed out, adding that amid the “health emergency”, the national capital has witnessed a manifold increase in hospital visits and children and elderly are also among those affected. “The existing situation is violative of fundamental rights of citizens.”Wrote to Hon'ble CM, Punjab yesterday, urging him to take urgent measures to control Parali burning by making Farmers willing partners in defeating the deadly pollution in Delhi-NCR.

Stopped the ""Red Light On, Car Off"" campaign and are doing politics by writing to me? Politics is not right on such a serious subject,” he tweeted in Hindi.Earlier, at a joint briefing, Mann - along with Arvind Kejriwal - said the AAP government takes responsibility for farm fires in Punjab. He also urged the central government to intervene. Both the leaders further pointed that six months were not enough for the AAP government - which took charge earlier this year - to tackle the issue.The Delhi Chief Minister also insisted that “blame game” should not be done on the “sensitive matter”.A newsroom junkie with 11+ years of experience with print and online publications; travel and books are the soup for the soul.

No proof quota in politics leads to incompetence: Abhishek Banerjee,https://www.hindustantimes.com//india-news/no-proof-quota-in-politics-leads-to-incompetence-abhishek-banerjee-101667587601157.html,"There is no evidence that reservation for women, scheduled castes and tribes in politics leads to massive incompetence, said Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee on Friday, adding that independent women legislators are emerging because of it.Subscribe Now! Get features likeThere is no evidence that reservation for women, scheduled castes and tribes in politics leads to massive incompetence, said Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee on Friday, adding that independent women legislators are emerging because of it.Delivering the 27th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture on the topic “Democracy on the Ground: What works, what doesn’t and why”, Banerjee countered the criticism that reservation is anti-merit. “While there are often claims that somehow this (reservation) will lead to massive incompetence, you see no evidence of it. What you see, over a period of time is independent women legislators emerging as a result of it.”“There is very compelling evidence that reservation, both for SC/ST and women, has had a salutary effect,” the Indian-origin American economist said.Also read: Goyal blames Delhi, Punjab’s AAP govts for pollution in national capitalHe added that these were the findings based on studies conducted by experts, including his wife Esther Duflo who has researched in this area,Both Banerjee and Duflo were named co-winners of the 2019 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel. The duo, who are professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge shared this honour with Harvard University economist Michael Kremer for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.On Friday, Banerjee also termed reservation as a “failure by design” in democracy.Due to reservation in local bodies, he said, “A lot of persons elected to local self-government bodies do not get a second run due to rotation of seats to accommodate reservation. So we want local democracy but we also want reservation. That’s a failure by design.”Banerjee said that an average constituency in India is quite big compared to electoral constituencies abroad. This impacts elections as voters hardly get information about their elected representatives and whatever little the elected leaders do, satisfies a small portion of the electorate.“If we want democracy to work, we should have smaller constituencies,” Banerjee said.Making a comparison, he said that Indian Lok Sabha has 540 seats while the British House of Commons has 650 Members of Parliament. The population here is 20 times that of the United Kingdom with each constituency being 24 times larger than those existing there, he noted.“When constituencies are large, it is hard to get information about legislators. Leaders on ground matter very little for individuals. We do not have a direct mechanism for rewarding legislators. Whatever they do, affects a little segment in their constituency. This breeds indifference among people. This ultimately impacts voting patterns,” he said.Sharing from his experimental work carried out in India, Banerjee explained that when voters are told about their legislators, it impacts their choices. In the absence of this information, he said, “Voters begin to think that ‘the system does not deliver much in any case, so why don’t I vote for my caste or someone who sounds similar to my name’....This is partly because they have no idea what their legislators do.”Sharing data from Uttar Pradesh for the years between 1980 and 1996, Banerjee said that as more people from a particular caste were elected, corruption among them rose.Also read: AAP govt to showcase ‘The City That Cares’ at Pragati Maidan fair“There is tolerance of people from your own caste of people who are corrupt. They say that they come from ‘their’ party. The more dominant (caste) that you are, the worse legislators you elect. This is the striking thing that ethno-centricity does. You are ethno-centric because you have no stake in politics.”He also touched upon other structural problems in education, health where the priority of elected leaders is different from that of voters. “How does one change the distribution of power within the system so that democracy can function within the system is a thought I leave you with,” he added.The lecture was given in honour of former Delhi high court judge, Justice Sunanda Bhandare who died at the age of 52 in 1994. The event was presided by Supreme Court judge, justice Hima Kohli and attended by justice Sidharth Mridul of the Delhi high court and former Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan B Lokur.The gathering, comprising mostly of former judges, academicians, social workers and legal luminaries, observed a minute’s silence to remember another champion of women’s rights and SEWA founder Elaben Bhatt who passed away on November 2.Personalise your news feed.

When I met Arvind ji, he told me that to clean the mess, you need to enter it. It was then that I decided to join politics.”“Isudan hails from a small place near Khambhaliya town in Saurashtra where his family is engaged in farming.

It will be interesting to see how his role as CM candidate plays out ,” said Satish Mori, channel head for Praveg TV.Mori first hired Gadhvi as a journalist for a news channel in Vapi after he completed his postgraduate diploma in journalism from Gujarat Vidyapith, Ahmedabad, in 2005. “The day he decided to quit journalism, he came and told me he is going to soon join politics,” Mori added.Gadhvi became known across Gujarat, thanks to Mahamanthan, a prime-time show he hosted between 2015 and 2021.He comes from a family of farmers in Dwarka district, and is from the OBC community, which accounts for 48% of the state’s population.Elections for the 182-member Gujarat assembly will be held in two phases on December 1 and 5. The results will be announced on December 8.Kejriwal said over 1.6 million people voted in the poll to select the CM candidate, of which 73% preferred Gadhvi. Last week, Kejriwal urged people to contact the party through SMS, WhatsApp, voice mail and e-mail to give their views about who should be the CM candidate from the party.“During the Punjab elections, we had asked people as to who should be the next chief minister. People named Bhagwant Mann by a huge majority. And as per the wishes of the public, we made him the chief minister,” Kejriwal said.State AAP chief Italia said Gadhvi had worked hard to reach his current position.Also read: Goyal blames Delhi, Punjab’s AAP govts for pollution in national capital“He is a capable person and I am sure that under his leadership, AAP will form the government in Gujarat,” he said.State Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi hit out at the AAP: “We are sure Gadhvi will try his best to carry the duties cut out for him. His role is very well defined and it is to ensure his party cuts maximum number of Congress votes. AAP is the B-team of BJP.”Gujarat BJP spokesperson Yamal Vyas declined to comment on the matter.Experts were apprehensive of the fallout of AAP’s decision. “The AAP has tried to score a point over Congress by declaring a CM candidate. I will not be surprised if some senior leaders quit over this decision...,” said Vidyut Joshi, former vice-chancellor of the Bhavnagar University, alluding to Gadhvi’s recent entry into politics.Personalise your news feed.
