Get features likeThe Delhi Police on Saturday registered an FIR against \\'The Wire\\' after BJP\\'s IT-cell head Amit Malviya registered a complaint alleging that the media company “forged documents with a view to malign and tarnish\" his reputation.The Wire, its founder Siddharth Varadarajan, its founder editors Sidharth Bhatia and MK Venu and its deputy editor and executive news producer Jahnavi Sen have been named in the FIR which has been registered under Sections 420, 468, 469, 471, 500 r/w 120B and 34 IPC, news agency ANI reported.The matter pertains to Meta stories which were \"retracted\" by the news website. It retracted the stories after Meta and various other experts pointed out critical flaws in their reporting.Malviya has alleged that on October 6, 2022, The Wire had published a report claiming that Meta (the parent company that owns Facebook and Instagram) had removed an Instagram post within a few minutes of it being uploaded by a private account namely \"Cringearchivist\". The report claimed that the company regularly colludes with members of the BJP in removing content deemed unfavourable to the party.He further alleged that on October 10 the news portal went on to claim that “I was the nodal point, interfacing between the party and Meta, for said censorship activity, having been bestowed certain \\'XCheck\\' and other privileges by the company”.\"As per the report, this status had bestowed on me the following powers overriding any filters, algorithms, vetting, verification or any other checks and balances within the company,\" Malviya said in a statement.The BJP leader also alleged that the report went on to cite alleged internal correspondence of Meta to justify its claims, alleging had used said privileges to take down a total of 705 posts to date.\"On October 11, 2022, Meta\\'s Communication Head, Andy Stone, issued a categorical denial and stated that the documents presented by \\'The Wire\\' in its report were fabricated\\' and that the ‘Xcheck’ status had been mischaracterized. Once Meta issued this statement, \\'The Wire\\' should have at the very least paused its coverage of this issue and commenced an internal audit. Instead, on the same day, it went on to publish yet another malicious report claiming to have accessed further internal emails of Meta employees, namely those exchanged between Andy Stone and his team, purportedly trying to effect a coverup,\" he said.He stated that The Wire publicly apologised to its readers on October 27 and retracted the stories about \"XCheck\" and Meta after scathing public scrutiny and the exposure of significant fabrication of dates, times and content in its alleged \"proof\".\"However, even while retracting the story, The Wire\\' refrained from apologising to me, despite maligning and tarnishing my reputation and causing serious harm to my professional career. My role requires me to vociferously advocate the BJP\\'s point of view on national issues, across platforms,\" he said.\"This role is based on trust and camaraderie, between me and my interlocutors across platforms and more importantly with the public. However, The Wire\\'s stories have vitiated the atmosphere and severely dented relationships and trust built over the years for me to carry out the functions of my responsibility,\" the BJP leader added.Stating that The Wire and some unknown persons entered into a \"criminal conspiracy\" with the intent to \"malign and tarnish\" his reputation, he said that the news portal \"deliberately\" inserted his name into a story, and \"fabricated\" evidence to \"implicate\" him.\"Consequently, I am left with no option other than to seek appropriate legal remedies against The Wire and its management/reporters. As mentioned yesterday, will lodge an FIR with the concerned police station under sections that deal with forgery, forgery for the purposes of cheating, forgery to harm reputation, defamation, cheating and criminal conspiracy among others. Additionally, I will also initiate appropriate civil action for damages against The Wire and its associates,\" Malviya added.Last week, The Wire formally retracted its Meta stories “after conducting an internal review of the technical source material used, with the help of external experts”.Meta is the parent firm of Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook.The Wire said it is also conducting a comprehensive editorial review of the internal editorial processes \"which resulted in the publication of these stories in order to identify and plug any and all shortcomings\".(With inputs from agencies)Have 11 years\\' experience in print and digital media.

Get features likeSince Pakistan faced a shock defeat to Zimbabwe in the T20 World Cup on Thursday, the fans and former cricketers have been immensely critical of the side. The Babar Azam-led side had already lost against India in its opening game of the World Cup, and failed to chase down a 130-run target against Zimbabwe in its second match of the tournament. Moreover, Babar Azam's statement in the post-match presentation didn't sit well with a number of former cricketers, including ex-captain Salman Butt.The former Pakistan skipper, in his YouTube video, lashed out at Babar after the captain seemingly indicated that Zimbabwe had scored 10 more runs than expected on the wicket.Also read: 'Ramiz Raja should resign immediately; Babar is top batter but what's his contribution?': Ex-PAK cricketer's fiery rantReacting to the comment, Butt said, “Kal se, I haven't thought beyond the statement jo hamaare kaptaan ne, hamaare best player ne, duniya ke top player ne baat ki thi, ki 10 run zyada the. Yaar 130 me bhi 10 zyada the? Ye kya statement hai? 130 bhi bada lag raha hai score? (I couldn't move on from the statement from our captain, our best player yesterday. He said that they scored 10 runs more. Are you saying that even in 130 runs, they scored 10 extra? What was this statement?),” Butt asked furiously.In fact, Butt didn't even mince his words on his video caption. As the session also included Pakistan pacer Wahab Riaz, the video was titled, “Salman and Wahab on Babar's ‘Foolish’ Statement | Zimbabwe Loss.”Butt went on to take a dig at Babar over the statement. “Kya kare bowler? Doosri team ke balley gaayab kar lein? Kya karein? Kaise zyada tha score. Ye baat unhone presentation me kahi hai. (What can the bowler do? Do they start hiding opposition players' bats? How was this score big? He said this in presentation!),” Butt further stated.The opening duo of Babar (4) and Mohammad Rizwan (14) had failed to step up in the run-chase against Zimbabwe and no batter barring Shan Masood (44) could make a mark, as Pakistan fell short by a run. The loss – again – exposed Pakistan's middle-order weakness, that has been one of the primary concerns among many of the side's former cricketers in the lead-up to the tournament.Pakistan will return to action on Sunday later this week when the side takes on Netherlands in Perth.At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

When asked about her thoughts on Bollywood films not working at the box office, compared with films from the South film industry, Kangana told Aaj Tak, “There are various kinds of analysis about films’ performance. If you look at hit films, all of them have Indian roots. Look at Kantara. These films show India on a micro level, based on devotion and spirituality. Ponniyin Selvan-1 is also about Cholas.”“Bollywood has gone far away from its Indian culture and they have westernised films. With the trend to make westernised films, I think people are unable to relate themselves to the film. Meri bhi iss saal ek film nahin chali hain. Usse bhi mujhe yehi seekh mili ki sayad bohot hi westernised character tha jisse log identify nahin kar payein (Even one of my films didn’t work this year I have learned that may be my character was too westernised, which Indian couldn’t identify),” the actor also reasoned.She feels there’s a sudden sense of pride among the Indian audience, and they are rooting for those who are connecting them to it only.

If we had played the same bowling attack in the first match, we wouldn't have let India chase the target. I've been saying this since the England series, but no one listens to ex-cricketers.

Varna vo itna under-pressure aayega, agar Babar ya mere chachu samajhte hain, usko step down kar dena chahiye. (If you want 22-25,000 runs from him, you have to keep him purely as a player or else he would be under-pressure. If Babar or his father understand this, he should step down).”Akmal further urged Babar to focus on his game “like Virat Kohli,” adding that the Pakistan batter not realising his full potential would be a “great loss” for the side.“Apni cricket me focus karein, jaise Virat Kohli focus karta hai. Kyunki iske baad koi batsman mere ko nazar nahi aa raha hai. Bada nuksaan hoga Pakistan cricket ka agar ye jaldi team se chala gaya toh. (He should focus on his cricket like Virat Kohli.

While the Babar Azam-led side faced a dramatic four-wicket defeat to India, their match against Zimbabwe was also decided on the final ball with the side conceding a heartbreaking one-run loss. Despite restricting the Zimbabwean side to 130/8, Pakistan endured a middle-order collapse as they fell a run short in the chase.Following the defeat, the Pakistan cricketers faced brutal criticism from fans and former cricketers alike and during the pre-match conference ahead of the side's match against Netherlands, a reporter asked pacer Haris Rauf if Pakistan took Zimbabwe “lightly”.Also read: 'Agar Babar ya mere chachu samajhte hain, toh usko World Cup ke baad...': Akmal's huge statement on 'brother' Babar Azam“Haris, Zimbabwe bhi halki team hai, aur Netherlands bhi.

The fast bowler insisted that no team is weak when it comes to ICC tournaments, and the players give their 100 percent regardless of the opposition.“Dekhein aapne baat ki, Zimbabwe halki team hai.

This group of diseases is usually treated with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs,\" Dr Agarwal saysDr Menon says if the causes are viral infections, it is usually self-limiting; if it is due to drugs, it resolves once the medication is stopped but the commonest cause is autoimmune, where there are antibodies in the body which target the muscle cells causing inflammation which translates into pain, soreness and weakness.\"Myositis caused due to viral infections is typically diagnosed by blood tests including CBC, ESR, CRP and CPK which is a muscle enzyme which rises dramatically when there is a myositis. Diagnosis maybe sometimes confirmed by an EMG which is a nerve muscle study and a muscle biopsy. The treatment, if autoimmune typically needs steroids or immunosuppressants.

Get features likeNew research shows that mindful use of smartphones, without minimizing screen time, enhances productivity.According to research recently published by Kaveh Abhari of San Diego State University and Isaac Vaghefi of City University of New York, using existing smartphone applications to monitor cellphone screen time can enhance focused or mindful cellphone usage, which, in turn, leads to higher perceived productivity and user satisfaction. The research was recently published in AIS Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction (THCI). (Also read: Excessive screen time on devices is linked with psychological issues and obesity )Abhari (associate professor of management information systems at SDSU\\'s Fowler College of Business) and Vaghefi (assistant professor of information systems at the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College) said while there was substantial research establishing the negative effects of cellphone screen time (intolerance, withdrawal, and conflict with job-related tasks), their research was designed to determine if self-regulatory behaviors could lead to modified user behavior for more positive outcomes.\"We theorized that individuals who tracked their cellphone usage and set goals surrounding that usage tended to have enhanced productivity and contentment with their productivity as they met their stated objectives,\" said Abhari. \"Previous research has shown that goal setting tends to raise performance expectations and we wanted to see if this theory held true for smartphone screen time as well.\"To make this determination, the researchers surveyed 469 participating university undergraduate students in California, New York, and Hawaii. The three-week survey required all participants to complete four questionnaires and about half of them were required to download a screen-monitoring application to their phones. This app allowed users to monitor and set limits or goals with their cellphone screen time.When the results were analyzed, researchers measured the perceived productivity of screen time reported by those surveyed, as well as the amount of screen time and the fatigue associated with self-monitoring. They also reviewed participants\\' contentment with their productivity achieved through cellphone screen time. \"Self-monitoring appears necessary to encourage the optimized use of smartphones,\" said Abhari. \"The results suggest that optimizing but not minimizing screen time is more likely to increase user productivity.\"However, the researchers also found that self-monitoring induces fatigue and weakens the effect on productivity, though it was not a significant factor affecting the relationship between self-monitoring and contentment with productivity achievement.In conclusion, Abhari and Vaghefi determined that while uncontrolled cellphone use (or cellphone addiction) could negatively impact people\\'s lives, monitored screen time particularly monitored screen time with specific goals in mind can result in positive outcomes and higher overall user satisfaction. \"This study could lead system developers to embed features into mobile devices that enable self-monitoring,\" said Abhari. \"These features could improve quality screen time and enhance the relationship between humans and digital technology.\"Follow more stories on Facebook & TwitterPersonalise your news feed.

Myo means muscle, itis means inflammation. This is a condition which can have various causes including viral infections, medication and autoimmune status,\" says Dr Sudha Menon, Director - Department of Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road.Dr. Santosh Kumar Agrawal, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, Marengo QRG Hospital Faridabad says myositis is an autoimmune condition in which patient’s muscles get attacked by its own immune system.\"It usually affects arms, shoulders, legs, hips, abdomen and spinal muscles. In advanced stages it may affect muscles of esophagus (food pipe), diaphragm and eyes. Patients usually experience difficulty while standing up after sitting, climbing stairs, lifting objects etc,\" says Dr Agarwal.\"Myositis typically presents with severe pain in the muscles with soreness, weakness of the muscles and difficulty in performing activities of daily life. It can be associated with low grade fever, rashes and joint pains,\" says Dr Menon.Dr Agarwal says the other symptoms of the disease include fever, weight loss, joint pain, fatigue and muscle pain.\"These conditions are usually diagnosed after clinical examination, blood work up, MR Imaging, EMG and muscle biopsy. This group of diseases is usually treated with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs,\" Dr Agarwal saysDr Menon says if the causes are viral infections, it is usually self-limiting; if it is due to drugs, it resolves once the medication is stopped but the commonest cause is autoimmune, where there are antibodies in the body which target the muscle cells causing inflammation which translates into pain, soreness and weakness.\"Myositis caused due to viral infections is typically diagnosed by blood tests including CBC, ESR, CRP and CPK which is a muscle enzyme which rises dramatically when there is a myositis. Diagnosis maybe sometimes confirmed by an EMG which is a nerve muscle study and a muscle biopsy. The treatment, if autoimmune typically needs steroids or immunosuppressants. The disease can be lifelong so the treatment may be indefinite,\" concludes Dr Sudha Menon, Director - Department of Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road.Follow more stories on Facebook & TwitterPersonalise your news feed.

While some of the major French and British museums interviewed by AFP, including the Louvre, the National Gallery and the Tate in London, are keeping a low profile on the issue, others are calling for stronger protective measures against such acts.\"Art is defenceless and we strongly condemn trying to damage it for whichever cause,\" the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague said in a statement.It was in the Mauritshuis that Johannes Vermeer\\'s masterpiece \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" was targeted by climate activists this week.Two activists glued themselves to the painting and adjoining wall, while another threw a thick red substance, but the artwork was behind glass and undamaged, and returned to public view on Friday.Social media images showed the activists wearing \"Just Stop Oil\" T-shirts.\"How do you feel?\" one of them asked. \"This painting is protected by glass but... the future of our children is not protected.\"That attack came after environmental activists splashed tomato soup on Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh\\'s \"Sunflowers\" at the National Gallery in London, and threw mashed potato over a Claude Monet painting at the Barberini Museum in Potsdam, Germany.Bernard Blistene, honorary president of the modern art Centre Pompidou in Paris, said all museum managers had been taking precautions against vandalism for a very long time.\"Should we take more? No doubt,\" he said.- Ban on bags? -Ortrud Westheider, director of the Barberini Museum, said the recent attacks showed \"international security standards for the protection of artworks in case of activist attacks are not sufficient\".Eco-militants from the Last Generation group hurled mashed potato onto Monet\\'s \"Les Meules\" (Haystacks) at the museum.The group later published a video on social media, writing: \"If it takes a painting -- with #MashedPotatoes or #TomatoSoup thrown at it -- to make society remember that the fossil fuel course is killing us all: Then we\\'ll give you #MashedPotatoes on a painting!\"The museum said the painting was protected by glass and had not suffered damage.In a similar stunt on October 14, two environmental protesters hit van Gogh\\'s world-renowned work with tomato soup in London. The gallery said the protesters caused \"minor damage\" to the frame but the painting was \"unharmed\".Remigiusz Plath, security expert for the German museums association DMB and the Hasso Plattner Foundation, said the string of art attacks was \"clearly a kind of escalation process\".\"There are different ways of reacting and of course all museums have to think about extended security measures -- measures that were previously very unusual for museums in Germany and in Europe, that were perhaps only known in the US,\" he said.Such measures could include a complete ban on bags and jackets as well as security searches.\"The environmental catastrophe and the climate crisis are of course also a matter of concern to us... But we have absolutely no tolerance for vandalism,\" he added.The Prado museum in the Spanish capital has said it was \"on alert\".At the Queen Sofia museum in Madrid, conservation expert Jorge Garcia Gomez-Tejedo told Spanish media this week, only the most vulnerable works are displayed behind armoured glass.- \\'Nihilism\\' -Adam Weinberg, of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, has questioned the activists\\' approach.\"It\\'s people putting themselves on a stage in order to bring attention to something, but you have to ask, does this really change anything?\" he said at a discussion on Wednesday in Qatar, according to ARTNews.Tristram Hunt, of London\\'s Victoria and Albert Museum, voiced concern at the \"nihilistic language around the protests that there is no place for art in times of crisis\".\"I don\\'t agree,\" he said at the same event.France\\'s Culture minister Rima Abdul Malak has called on \"all national museums to redouble their vigilance\".\"How can... defending the climate lead to wanting to destroy a work of art? It\\'s absolutely absurd,\" she told Le Parisien daily.In May, Leonardo da Vinci\\'s \"Mona Lisa\" had a custard pie thrown in her face at the Louvre museum in Paris, but the artwork\\'s thick bulletproof case ensured she came to no harm.Her attacker said he was taking aim at artists who are not focusing enough on \"the planet\".For Didier Rykner, founder of online French magazine La Tribune de l\\'art, these acts of protest are \"counterproductive\" and \"the more visibility they are given, the more they will do it again\".But \"by becoming commonplace, these acts undoubtedly lose their force,\" he argued.Personalise your news feed.

Get features likeThe Delhi Police on Saturday registered an FIR against 'The Wire' after BJP's IT-cell head Amit Malviya registered a complaint alleging that the media company “forged documents with a view to malign and tarnish\" his reputation.The Wire, its founder Siddharth Varadarajan, its founder editors Sidharth Bhatia and MK Venu and its deputy editor and executive news producer Jahnavi Sen have been named in the FIR which has been registered under Sections 420, 468, 469, 471, 500 r/w 120B and 34 IPC, news agency ANI reported.The matter pertains to Meta stories which were \"retracted\" by the news website. It retracted the stories after Meta and various other experts pointed out critical flaws in their reporting.Malviya has alleged that on October 6, 2022, The Wire had published a report claiming that Meta (the parent company that owns Facebook and Instagram) had removed an Instagram post within a few minutes of it being uploaded by a private account namely \"Cringearchivist\". The report claimed that the company regularly colludes with members of the BJP in removing content deemed unfavourable to the party.He further alleged that on October 10 the news portal went on to claim that “I was the nodal point, interfacing between the party and Meta, for said censorship activity, having been bestowed certain 'XCheck' and other privileges by the company”.\"As per the report, this status had bestowed on me the following powers overriding any filters, algorithms, vetting, verification or any other checks and balances within the company,\" Malviya said in a statement.The BJP leader also alleged that the report went on to cite alleged internal correspondence of Meta to justify its claims, alleging had used said privileges to take down a total of 705 posts to date.\"On October 11, 2022, Meta's Communication Head, Andy Stone, issued a categorical denial and stated that the documents presented by 'The Wire' in its report were fabricated' and that the ‘Xcheck’ status had been mischaracterized. Once Meta issued this statement, 'The Wire' should have at the very least paused its coverage of this issue and commenced an internal audit. Instead, on the same day, it went on to publish yet another malicious report claiming to have accessed further internal emails of Meta employees, namely those exchanged between Andy Stone and his team, purportedly trying to effect a coverup,\" he said.He stated that The Wire publicly apologised to its readers on October 27 and retracted the stories about \"XCheck\" and Meta after scathing public scrutiny and the exposure of significant fabrication of dates, times and content in its alleged \"proof\".\"However, even while retracting the story, The Wire' refrained from apologising to me, despite maligning and tarnishing my reputation and causing serious harm to my professional career. My role requires me to vociferously advocate the BJP's point of view on national issues, across platforms,\" he said.\"This role is based on trust and camaraderie, between me and my interlocutors across platforms and more importantly with the public. However, The Wire's stories have vitiated the atmosphere and severely dented relationships and trust built over the years for me to carry out the functions of my responsibility,\" the BJP leader added.Stating that The Wire and some unknown persons entered into a \"criminal conspiracy\" with the intent to \"malign and tarnish\" his reputation, he said that the news portal \"deliberately\" inserted his name into a story, and \"fabricated\" evidence to \"implicate\" him.\"Consequently, I am left with no option other than to seek appropriate legal remedies against The Wire and its management/reporters. As mentioned yesterday, will lodge an FIR with the concerned police station under sections that deal with forgery, forgery for the purposes of cheating, forgery to harm reputation, defamation, cheating and criminal conspiracy among others. Additionally, I will also initiate appropriate civil action for damages against The Wire and its associates,\" Malviya added.Last week, The Wire formally retracted its Meta stories “after conducting an internal review of the technical source material used, with the help of external experts”.Meta is the parent firm of Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook.The Wire said it is also conducting a comprehensive editorial review of the internal editorial processes \"which resulted in the publication of these stories in order to identify and plug any and all shortcomings\".(With inputs from agencies)Have 11 years' experience in print and digital media.

Get features likeRussia on Saturday suspended its participation in a landmark agreement that allowed vital grain exports from Ukraine, blaming drone attacks on Russian ships in Crimea.Russia made the announcement after its army accused Kyiv earlier Saturday of a \"massive\" drone attack on its Black Sea fleet, which Ukraine labelled a \"false pretext\" and the UN urged the deal's preservation.The Turkey and UN-brokered deal to unlock grain exports signed between Russia and Ukraine in July is critical to easing the global food crisis caused by the conflict.The agreement already allowed more than nine million tonnes of Ukrainian grain to be exported and was due to be renewed on November 19.A Turkish security source told AFP that Ankara had not been \"officially notified\" of Russia's suspension, while Ukraine and the UN pushed for the agreement to remain in force.\"I call on all states to demand that Russia stop its hunger games and recommit to fulfilling its obligations,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN secretary-general, said: \"It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative which is a critical humanitarian effort.\"- 'Peddling false claims' -Sevastopol in Moscow-annexed Crimea has been targeted several times in recent months and serves as the headquarters for the Black Sea fleet and a logistical hub for operations in Ukraine.The Russian army claimed to have \"destroyed\" nine aerial drones and seven maritime ones, in an attack in the port early Saturday.\"In light of the terrorist act carried out by the Kyiv regime with the participation of British experts against ships of the Black Sea fleet and civilian vessels involved in the security of grain corridors, Russia suspends its participation in the implementation of the agreement on the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports,\" the Russian defence ministry said on Telegram.Moscow's forces alleged British \"specialists\", whom they said were based in the southern Ukrainian city of Ochakiv, had helped prepare and train Kyiv to carry out the strike.In a further singling out of the UK -- which Moscow sees as one of the most unfriendly Western countries -- Russia said the same British unit was involved in explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines last month.Britain strongly rebutted both claims, saying \"the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.\"Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Saturday Moscow would raise the blasts and the alleged drone attack at the UN Security Council.The British defence ministry said this \"invented story says more about arguments going on inside the Russian Government than it does about the West\".Moscow's military said ships targeted at their Crimean base were involved in the grain deal.Russia had recently criticised the deal, saying its own grain exports have suffered due to Western sanctions.- 'Massive' attack -Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, said Saturday's drone attack was the \"most massive\" the peninsula had seen.The city's services were on \"alert\", but he claimed no \"civilian infrastructure\" had been damaged.City authorities said the harbour was \"temporarily\" closed to boats and ferries and urged people \"not to panic\".Attacks on Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, have increased in recent weeks, as Kyiv presses a counter-offensive in the south to retake territory held by Moscow for months.Moscow-installed authorities in Kherson, just north of Crimea, have vowed to turn the city into a fortress, preparing for an inevitable assault.On Thursday, Razvozhayev said a thermal power station had been attacked in Balaklava, in the Sevastopol area.He claimed there was only minor damage and no casualties.In early October, Moscow's bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland -- personally inaugurated by President Vladimir Putin in 2018 -- was damaged by a blast that Putin blamed on Ukraine.The Russian fleet stationed in the port had also been attacked by a drone in August.Russia's allegations Saturday came as the Ukrainian army reported fighting in the Lugansk and Donetsk regions in the east, including near Bakhmut -- the only area where Moscow's forces have advanced in recent weeks.Pro-Russian separatists fighting alongside Moscow also announced a new prisoner exchange with Kyiv, saying 50 will return home from each side.Both sides were gearing up for the battle for the city of Kherson, the regional capital that fell to Moscow's forces in the first days of their offensive.Personalise your news feed.

Get features likeSince Pakistan faced a shock defeat to Zimbabwe in the T20 World Cup on Thursday, the fans and former cricketers have been immensely critical of the side. The Babar Azam-led side had already lost against India in its opening game of the World Cup, and failed to chase down a 130-run target against Zimbabwe in its second match of the tournament. Moreover, Babar Azam's statement in the post-match presentation didn't sit well with a number of former cricketers, including ex-captain Salman Butt.The former Pakistan skipper, in his YouTube video, lashed out at Babar after the captain seemingly indicated that Zimbabwe had scored 10 more runs than expected on the wicket.Also read: 'Ramiz Raja should resign immediately; Babar is top batter but what's his contribution?': Ex-PAK cricketer's fiery rantReacting to the comment, Butt said, “Kal se, I haven't thought beyond the statement jo hamaare kaptaan ne, hamaare best player ne, duniya ke top player ne baat ki thi, ki 10 run zyada the. Yaar 130 me bhi 10 zyada the? Ye kya statement hai? 130 bhi bada lag raha hai score? (I couldn't move on from the statement from our captain, our best player yesterday. He said that they scored 10 runs more. Are you saying that even in 130 runs, they scored 10 extra? What was this statement?),” Butt asked furiously.In fact, Butt didn't even mince his words on his video caption. As the session also included Pakistan pacer Wahab Riaz, the video was titled, “Salman and Wahab on Babar's ‘Foolish’ Statement | Zimbabwe Loss.”Butt went on to take a dig at Babar over the statement. “Kya kare bowler? Doosri team ke balley gaayab kar lein? Kya karein? Kaise zyada tha score. Ye baat unhone presentation me kahi hai. (What can the bowler do? Do they start hiding opposition players' bats? How was this score big? He said this in presentation!),” Butt further stated.The opening duo of Babar (4) and Mohammad Rizwan (14) had failed to step up in the run-chase against Zimbabwe and no batter barring Shan Masood (44) could make a mark, as Pakistan fell short by a run. The loss – again – exposed Pakistan's middle-order weakness, that has been one of the primary concerns among many of the side's former cricketers in the lead-up to the tournament.Pakistan will return to action on Sunday later this week when the side takes on Netherlands in Perth.At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

When asked about her thoughts on Bollywood films not working at the box office, compared with films from the South film industry, Kangana told Aaj Tak, “There are various kinds of analysis about films’ performance. If you look at hit films, all of them have Indian roots. Look at Kantara. These films show India on a micro level, based on devotion and spirituality. Ponniyin Selvan-1 is also about Cholas.”“Bollywood has gone far away from its Indian culture and they have westernised films.

The Tesla CEO also said he wanted to prevent it from becoming an echo chamber for hate and division.According to a Reuters report, Musk said he did not buy Twitter to earn more money but ‘to try to help humanity’ whom he loved.

Get features likePakistan have endured a disastrous start to their 2022 T20 World Cup campaign. After facing a dramatic four-wicket loss to arch-rivals India in their tournament opener last Sunday, the Babar Azam-led side faced a shock defeat to minnows Zimbabwe in their second match. Despite restricting the men in maroon to a paltry score of 130/8, Pakistan failed to chase down the target as they fell short by one run.Justifiably, the Pakistan cricket fraternity is left disappointed with the side's performance in the tournament so far. While many believe that many of the Pakistan batters lack game-awareness, the side's senior wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal made a massive remark on Babar Azam after the losses. Akmal, who is also Babar's cousin, requested the star batter to “step down” from the leadership role for the betterment of his career.Also read: 'Most complete Indian batsman of my time': Australia's Greg Chappell reserves ultimate praise for star batter amid WC“Dekhein, ye toh nazar aa raha tha. Pehle match me ye bowling karaayi hoti toh hum runs naa chase karwaate. Ham kehte aa rahe hain England series me, koi sun nahi raha hai ego me aake. Koi ex-cricketers ki nahi sunta. Being an elder brother, agar Babar samajhta hai, agar PCB samajhta hai meri rai, Babar ko iss World Cup ke baad kaptaani nahi karni chahiye. (See, we can see that. If we had played the same bowling attack in the first match, we wouldn't have let India chase the target. I've been saying this since the England series, but no one listens to ex-cricketers. Being an elder brother, I want to say to Babar that he should leave the captaincy after the T20 World Cup),” Akmal said on ARY News.“Agar aapko uss se 22-25000 run karwaane hain, toh usko as a player khilaayein. Varna vo itna under-pressure aayega, agar Babar ya mere chachu samajhte hain, usko step down kar dena chahiye. (If you want 22-25,000 runs from him, you have to keep him purely as a player or else he would be under-pressure. If Babar or his father understand this, he should step down).”Akmal further urged Babar to focus on his game “like Virat Kohli,” adding that the Pakistan batter not realising his full potential would be a “great loss” for the side.“Apni cricket me focus karein, jaise Virat Kohli focus karta hai. Kyunki iske baad koi batsman mere ko nazar nahi aa raha hai. Bada nuksaan hoga Pakistan cricket ka agar ye jaldi team se chala gaya toh. (He should focus on his cricket like Virat Kohli.

Despite restricting the Zimbabwean side to 130/8, Pakistan endured a middle-order collapse as they fell a run short in the chase.Following the defeat, the Pakistan cricketers faced brutal criticism from fans and former cricketers alike and during the pre-match conference ahead of the side's match against Netherlands, a reporter asked pacer Haris Rauf if Pakistan took Zimbabwe “lightly”.Also read: 'Agar Babar ya mere chachu samajhte hain, toh usko World Cup ke baad...': Akmal's huge statement on 'brother' Babar Azam“Haris, Zimbabwe bhi halki team hai, aur Netherlands bhi.

(Zimbabwe isn't a strong team, neither is Netherlands, in terms of ranking. Pakistan relaxed a little and we couldn't even score 130. How will you take on the game against Netherlands?),” the reporter asked.Haris Rauf, however, had a rather straightforward remark to the same. The fast bowler insisted that no team is weak when it comes to ICC tournaments, and the players give their 100 percent regardless of the opposition.“Dekhein aapne baat ki, Zimbabwe halki team hai. Koi bhi tournament khelne aaye, vo halka nahi hota. Koi bhi international game khel rahe hain, vo bhi ussi mindset se aaye hain ki hamein World Cup jeetna hai.

We are playing an internaitonal match, and everyone has come with a mindset to win the World Cup. We can't take anyone lightly, we can't say that this team is good or this team isn't),” Haris stated.“Netherlands ya Zimbabwe se match ho, ya kisi se bhi ho, ham apna 100 percent dene ki koshish karte hain. Unfortunately, results hamaare favour me nahi the. Zimbabwe jeeti, vo achha khele. Agle match jiske saath bhi hain, ham apna best denge.

Myo means muscle, itis means inflammation. This is a condition which can have various causes including viral infections, medication and autoimmune status,\" says Dr Sudha Menon, Director - Department of Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road.Dr. Santosh Kumar Agrawal, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, Marengo QRG Hospital Faridabad says myositis is an autoimmune condition in which patient’s muscles get attacked by its own immune system.\"It usually affects arms, shoulders, legs, hips, abdomen and spinal muscles. In advanced stages it may affect muscles of esophagus (food pipe), diaphragm and eyes. Patients usually experience difficulty while standing up after sitting, climbing stairs, lifting objects etc,\" says Dr Agarwal.\"Myositis typically presents with severe pain in the muscles with soreness, weakness of the muscles and difficulty in performing activities of daily life. It can be associated with low grade fever, rashes and joint pains,\" says Dr Menon.Dr Agarwal says the other symptoms of the disease include fever, weight loss, joint pain, fatigue and muscle pain.\"These conditions are usually diagnosed after clinical examination, blood work up, MR Imaging, EMG and muscle biopsy. This group of diseases is usually treated with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs,\" Dr Agarwal saysDr Menon says if the causes are viral infections, it is usually self-limiting; if it is due to drugs, it resolves once the medication is stopped but the commonest cause is autoimmune, where there are antibodies in the body which target the muscle cells causing inflammation which translates into pain, soreness and weakness.\"Myositis caused due to viral infections is typically diagnosed by blood tests including CBC, ESR, CRP and CPK which is a muscle enzyme which rises dramatically when there is a myositis. Diagnosis maybe sometimes confirmed by an EMG which is a nerve muscle study and a muscle biopsy. The treatment, if autoimmune typically needs steroids or immunosuppressants. The disease can be lifelong so the treatment may be indefinite,\" concludes Dr Sudha Menon, Director - Department of Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road.Follow more stories on Facebook &amp; TwitterPersonalise your news feed.

New Zealand bowlers had wrapped up the game within the powerplay itself after Glenn Philips' magnificent century in Sydney. The experience of Trent Boult and Tim Southee saw New Zealand reduce Sri Lanka to five down for just 24 runs in 6.1 overs. It was only a matter of time before Sri Lanka had succumbed after the early onslaught and was eventually folded for just 102 runs.With the big win, New Zealand edged closer to the semi-finals with five points from three games and subsequently piled up trouble on England and Australia. New Zealand will next face England on November 1 at the Gabba and Ireland on November 4 at the Adelaide Oval in their last two group matches.

Get features likeIndia could put one foot in the semi-finals of the 2022 T20 World Cup if they win their next match on Sunday at the Perth Stadium. However, their opponents are a strong South African team who like India are yet to lose a match in this tournament. While India won both the matches they have played thus far, South Africa have one won and was almost in line to winning the other as well if it wasn't for the fact that rain forced the match to be abandoned.India's two wins thus far came on the back of some sensational knocks from their batters, with former captain Virat Kohli scoring back to back half centuries and remaining unbeaten. Former New Zealand fast bowler and commentator Danny Morrison, however, feels that South Africa's star-studded pace attack could prove to be a real challenge for the Indian batters.“Rohit (Sharma), KL (Rahul) is yet to really kick off, Suryakumar Yadav and of course, Virat Kohli. You put them up against (Kagiso) Rabada, (Anrich) Nortje, (Wayne) Parnell is making a bit of a comeback, (Keshav) Maharaj, (Tabraiz) Shamsi; South Africa have got a good bowling lineup to take on India. It is a hard one to pick. India probably get the nod given what has happened recently. But that man, South African side, look out,” said Morrison in a video for the tournament's website.“Nortje, Rabada have pace. Parnell brings in variety. Then you bring out the swing kings - Bhuvi and Shami. I like that but I just wonder about the intimidation of the South Africans. If they get it right, I am going a little bit for their bowling vs India's batting,” he said.South Africa also have a strong batting lineup, being the only team in the Super 12 stage to have scored more than 200 runs in a match. They scored 205/5 in their last match against Bangladesh, winning the game by a whopping 104 runs. Before that, they had restricted Zimbabwe to 79/5 in their nine-over innings of a rain-affected match. They had smashed their way to 51/0 in three overs before rain caused the match to be abandoned.At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

Despite rain causing havoc, particularly in Group 1, there have been time for some extraordinary matches that have featured teams considered as favourites stumbling to comparatively unheralded sides.Topping the least, unsurprisingly, is the thriller for the ages that was played out between India and Pakistan at a packed Melbourne Cricket Ground earlier this week.

Kohli smashed consecutive sixes from the final two deliveries of the penultimate over off the bowling of Haris Rauf, leading to a final over from Mohammad Nawaz that had to be seen to be believed.“There were wickets lost, waist high no balls, free hits, sixes, wides and byes in an action-packed final over that eventually saw India prevail by four wickets in a memorable encounter,” said the ICC in its description of the chaotic action in the 20th over of the Indian innings. Kohli ended the game unbeaten on 82 off 53 balls.Pakistan's stunning loss to Zimbabwe came next. Zimbabwe managed to get a low total of 130/8 on board but their bowlers ensured that the going would be extremely difficult for Pakistan. Star all-rounder Sikandar Raza had led the way with three wickets and he also effected the run out off the final ball that kept Pakistan down to 129/8. Zimbabwe won by a run and are suddenly in a better position to sneak through to the semi-finals.The other matches featured in the list are from the first round, with Ireland's sensational chase against Scotland being third on it.

Get features likeNew research shows that mindful use of smartphones, without minimizing screen time, enhances productivity.According to research recently published by Kaveh Abhari of San Diego State University and Isaac Vaghefi of City University of New York, using existing smartphone applications to monitor cellphone screen time can enhance focused or mindful cellphone usage, which, in turn, leads to higher perceived productivity and user satisfaction. The research was recently published in AIS Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction (THCI). (Also read: Excessive screen time on devices is linked with psychological issues and obesity )Abhari (associate professor of management information systems at SDSU's Fowler College of Business) and Vaghefi (assistant professor of information systems at the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College) said while there was substantial research establishing the negative effects of cellphone screen time (intolerance, withdrawal, and conflict with job-related tasks), their research was designed to determine if self-regulatory behaviors could lead to modified user behavior for more positive outcomes.\"We theorized that individuals who tracked their cellphone usage and set goals surrounding that usage tended to have enhanced productivity and contentment with their productivity as they met their stated objectives,\" said Abhari. \"Previous research has shown that goal setting tends to raise performance expectations and we wanted to see if this theory held true for smartphone screen time as well.\"To make this determination, the researchers surveyed 469 participating university undergraduate students in California, New York, and Hawaii. The three-week survey required all participants to complete four questionnaires and about half of them were required to download a screen-monitoring application to their phones. This app allowed users to monitor and set limits or goals with their cellphone screen time.When the results were analyzed, researchers measured the perceived productivity of screen time reported by those surveyed, as well as the amount of screen time and the fatigue associated with self-monitoring. They also reviewed participants' contentment with their productivity achieved through cellphone screen time. \"Self-monitoring appears necessary to encourage the optimized use of smartphones,\" said Abhari. \"The results suggest that optimizing but not minimizing screen time is more likely to increase user productivity.\"However, the researchers also found that self-monitoring induces fatigue and weakens the effect on productivity, though it was not a significant factor affecting the relationship between self-monitoring and contentment with productivity achievement.In conclusion, Abhari and Vaghefi determined that while uncontrolled cellphone use (or cellphone addiction) could negatively impact people's lives, monitored screen time particularly monitored screen time with specific goals in mind can result in positive outcomes and higher overall user satisfaction. \"This study could lead system developers to embed features into mobile devices that enable self-monitoring,\" said Abhari. \"These features could improve quality screen time and enhance the relationship between humans and digital technology.\"Follow more stories on Facebook &amp; TwitterPersonalise your news feed.

I guess it can only mean that I am one more day closer to recovery. I love you..THIS TOO SHALL PASS,\" she added.A post shared by Samantha (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\"Myositis is a condition where there is inflammation in the muscles. Myo means muscle, itis means inflammation. This is a condition which can have various causes including viral infections, medication and autoimmune status,\" says Dr Sudha Menon, Director - Department of Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road.Dr. Santosh Kumar Agrawal, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, Marengo QRG Hospital Faridabad says myositis is an autoimmune condition in which patient’s muscles get attacked by its own immune system.\"It usually affects arms, shoulders, legs, hips, abdomen and spinal muscles. In advanced stages it may affect muscles of esophagus (food pipe), diaphragm and eyes. Patients usually experience difficulty while standing up after sitting, climbing stairs, lifting objects etc,\" says Dr Agarwal.\"Myositis typically presents with severe pain in the muscles with soreness, weakness of the muscles and difficulty in performing activities of daily life. It can be associated with low grade fever, rashes and joint pains,\" says Dr Menon.Dr Agarwal says the other symptoms of the disease include fever, weight loss, joint pain, fatigue and muscle pain.\"These conditions are usually diagnosed after clinical examination, blood work up, MR Imaging, EMG and muscle biopsy. This group of diseases is usually treated with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs,\" Dr Agarwal saysDr Menon says if the causes are viral infections, it is usually self-limiting; if it is due to drugs, it resolves once the medication is stopped but the commonest cause is autoimmune, where there are antibodies in the body which target the muscle cells causing inflammation which translates into pain, soreness and weakness.\"Myositis caused due to viral infections is typically diagnosed by blood tests including CBC, ESR, CRP and CPK which is a muscle enzyme which rises dramatically when there is a myositis. Diagnosis maybe sometimes confirmed by an EMG which is a nerve muscle study and a muscle biopsy. The treatment, if autoimmune typically needs steroids or immunosuppressants. The disease can be lifelong so the treatment may be indefinite,\" concludes Dr Sudha Menon, Director - Department of Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road.Follow more stories on Facebook &amp; TwitterPersonalise your news feed.

Get features likeArt world professionals have slammed recent attacks on famous paintings by climate protesters as \"counterproductive\" and dangerous acts of vandalism. While some of the major French and British museums interviewed by AFP, including the Louvre, the National Gallery and the Tate in London, are keeping a low profile on the issue, others are calling for stronger protective measures against such acts.\"Art is defenceless and we strongly condemn trying to damage it for whichever cause,\" the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague said in a statement.It was in the Mauritshuis that Johannes Vermeer's masterpiece \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" was targeted by climate activists this week.Two activists glued themselves to the painting and adjoining wall, while another threw a thick red substance, but the artwork was behind glass and undamaged, and returned to public view on Friday.Social media images showed the activists wearing \"Just Stop Oil\" T-shirts.\"How do you feel?\" one of them asked. \"This painting is protected by glass but... the future of our children is not protected.\"That attack came after environmental activists splashed tomato soup on Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" at the National Gallery in London, and threw mashed potato over a Claude Monet painting at the Barberini Museum in Potsdam, Germany.Bernard Blistene, honorary president of the modern art Centre Pompidou in Paris, said all museum managers had been taking precautions against vandalism for a very long time.\"Should we take more? No doubt,\" he said.- Ban on bags? -Ortrud Westheider, director of the Barberini Museum, said the recent attacks showed \"international security standards for the protection of artworks in case of activist attacks are not sufficient\".Eco-militants from the Last Generation group hurled mashed potato onto Monet's \"Les Meules\" (Haystacks) at the museum.The group later published a video on social media, writing: \"If it takes a painting -- with #MashedPotatoes or #TomatoSoup thrown at it -- to make society remember that the fossil fuel course is killing us all: Then we'll give you #MashedPotatoes on a painting!\"The museum said the painting was protected by glass and had not suffered damage.In a similar stunt on October 14, two environmental protesters hit van Gogh's world-renowned work with tomato soup in London. The gallery said the protesters caused \"minor damage\" to the frame but the painting was \"unharmed\".Remigiusz Plath, security expert for the German museums association DMB and the Hasso Plattner Foundation, said the string of art attacks was \"clearly a kind of escalation process\".\"There are different ways of reacting and of course all museums have to think about extended security measures -- measures that were previously very unusual for museums in Germany and in Europe, that were perhaps only known in the US,\" he said.Such measures could include a complete ban on bags and jackets as well as security searches.\"The environmental catastrophe and the climate crisis are of course also a matter of concern to us... But we have absolutely no tolerance for vandalism,\" he added.The Prado museum in the Spanish capital has said it was \"on alert\".At the Queen Sofia museum in Madrid, conservation expert Jorge Garcia Gomez-Tejedo told Spanish media this week, only the most vulnerable works are displayed behind armoured glass.- 'Nihilism' -Adam Weinberg, of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, has questioned the activists' approach.\"It's people putting themselves on a stage in order to bring attention to something, but you have to ask, does this really change anything?\" he said at a discussion on Wednesday in Qatar, according to ARTNews.Tristram Hunt, of London's Victoria and Albert Museum, voiced concern at the \"nihilistic language around the protests that there is no place for art in times of crisis\".\"I don't agree,\" he said at the same event.France's Culture minister Rima Abdul Malak has called on \"all national museums to redouble their vigilance\".\"How can... defending the climate lead to wanting to destroy a work of art? It's absolutely absurd,\" she told Le Parisien daily.In May, Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" had a custard pie thrown in her face at the Louvre museum in Paris, but the artwork's thick bulletproof case ensured she came to no harm.Her attacker said he was taking aim at artists who are not focusing enough on \"the planet\".For Didier Rykner, founder of online French magazine La Tribune de l'art, these acts of protest are \"counterproductive\" and \"the more visibility they are given, the more they will do it again\".But \"by becoming commonplace, these acts undoubtedly lose their force,\" he argued.Personalise your news feed.
