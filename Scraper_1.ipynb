What surprised me was that every Bangladeshi in and outside the stadium chanted ‘Pakistan Zindabad’.\"Subscribe Now! Get features likePakistan\\'s former prime minister Imran Khan on Friday drew parallels from 1970 when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman-led Awami League wasn\\'t allowed to form the government despite winning the majority in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in the general elections.“What happened in East Pakistan? The largest party won, but they were not given the right. Instead, we took action against them,” said Khan drawing parallels between the 1971 liberation war and 2022 in Pakistan.“At the age of 18, I went to play an exhibition cricket match in Bangladesh. We won two matches against India. What surprised me was that every Bangladeshi in and outside the stadium chanted ‘Pakistan Zindabad’. That day, I realised the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan is the biggest tragedy,” Khan said in his first public remarks since the assassination attempt on him on Thursday.Khan was shot in the leg as he waved to crowds from a container mounted on a truck from where he was leading a protest march on the capital to press for early elections and calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.In erstwhile East Pakistan, a huge majority of the Bengali nation had favoured the Awami League, under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in the 1970 Pakistani general elections. The party had emerged as the largest party in the nation, gaining the exclusive mandate of Pakistan in terms both of seats and votes.The Pakistan Peoples Party failed to win any seats in East Pakistan. The Awami League\\'s failure to win any seats in then west Pakistan was used by Zulfikar Bhutto who argued that Mujibur had received \"no mandate or support from West Pakistan\". The then leaders of Pakistan, all from West Pakistan and PPP, strongly opposed the idea of an East Pakistani-led government.Meanwhile, Khan said on Friday that he would resume his protest march to Islamabad after recovering even as his supporters staged nationwide protests that blocked major roads.He said two shooters had tried to assassinate him, in a country with a history of politically motivated violence. He said one person was killed and 11 others were injured in Thursday\\'s attack in Wazirabad, about 170 km (106 miles) southeast of Islamabad.Khan also said the failed assassination attempt against him will push the people of Pakistan to take to the streets like in Sri Lanka.“Either we will have a peaceful revolution or a bloody one,” the former prime minister said, adding, “People will take to the streets like Sri Lanka. There will be chaos.”Have 11 years\\' experience in print and digital media.

Get features likeAmid his growing rift with the state government, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has written to President Droupadi Murmu alleging that he was not informed of a 10-day foreign trip taken by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the first week of October, people close to the Raj Bhavan said.It is customary for the chief minister to brief the Governor ahead of a foreign trip and then call on the head of the state upon return.The Governor has further alleged that he was unaware of the arrangements made to run the government while Vijayan was on the 10-day trip, said one of the people mentioned above, asking not to be named.Vijayan had travelled to Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom along with a contingent during the October trip and had stayed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for a few days before returning to the country.The CM’s office said Khan was informed about the trip when he visited Kannur to pay his respects to deceased Marxist leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on October 3.Also read: VIDEO | Six-year-old boy kicked in Kerala, BJP says 'Devil's own land'After his visit, the CM had held a press conference in the state capital on October 18 saying “it was a successful trip” aimed at boosting investment and cooperation with European countries.The governor wrote to President Murmu in the second week of October saying that he came to know about the trip through media reports, said the person mentioned above.Governor Khan further wrote that he was totally in the dark about the “long foreign trip of the CM and his entourage”, said another person, also asking not to be named.Ties between Khan and the state government have been deteriorating over the last two months.The uneasy relationship took a downward turn in August after the governor refused to sign 11 ordinances brought by the government, which was later forced to call a special session of the assembly to pass these legislations.Though Khan later signed a majority of the bills, he withheld his consent to two of them — one aiming to curtail powers of the Lokayukta and another to curtail the governor’s powers as the chancellor of universities.On Thursday, Khan had raised serious allegations against Vijayan saying his office was patronising smuggling activities in the state. He also rejected charges of interference in appointments in state’s universities levelled against him by the ruling front’s leaders. At a convention in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday, Vijayan and other LDF leaders attacked Khan alleging that he was trying to implement the agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in state universities.Also read: Man arrested in Kerala for allegedly assaulting minor boy for leaning on his carMeanwhile, activists belonging to the Students Federation of India (SFI) on Friday blocked the entry of acting vice- chancellor of APJ Abdul Kalam University Sisa Thomas, who was appointed by the Governor. Later, she entered the campus with police protection and a section of employees also protested against her.The appointment of an acting V-C was necessitated after the Supreme Court quashed the appointment of incumbent M S Rajashree last month for flouting norms of the University Grants Commission (UGC). Citing the apex court order, last month, the Governor had sent show-cause notices to 11 V-Cs saying their appointments also flouted UGC norms and they were not entitled to hold their offices in view of the judgment.Initially, the government recommended the name of Digital University V-C Saj Gopinath for the post but Khan turned it down as he was among the 11 V-Cs who were served show-cause notices.Later, the government proposed the name of higher education secretary Ishita Roy, a senior IAS officer, but this was also turned down citing a lack of experience or technical prowess.Personalise your news feed.

Get features likeMumbai: In a relief to the Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association (FRTWA), the Supreme Court (SC) has directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to maintain status quo on the issue of the rule mandating shops and establishments to display their names in Marathi.The FRTWA had approached the SC after their plea challenging the BMC’s decision on making Marathi signboards in Devnagri script mandatory was rejected by the high court (HC) in February this year. The BMC decision had further stated that shopkeepers failing to comply would be fined ₹1 lakh, which was also challenged by the federation. The SC has restrained the BMC from taking any action against retailers till the petition is decided in the SC.Speaking about the development, a FRTWA member said that apart from restraining the civic authority, the SC directed the federation to furnish a list of retailers who would be covered by the interim protection.The issue pertains to the challenge by the FRTWA to rule 35 of the Maharashtra Shops and Establishment Act, which stipulated that every commercial establishment signboard had to be in Marathi language in the Devanagari script along with any other language. The petition of FRTWA was heard by the HC division bench of justice Gautam Patel and justice Madhav Jamdar on February 23, 2022.The federation had submitted that the rule 35 was contrary to the Act and hence imposition of a penalty of ₹1 lakh for non-compliance was akin to putting an individual under a disability. The federation also submitted that the adoption of Marathi language by the state was only meant for official purposes and hence individuals could not be forced to accept the same.The bench was also informed that the rule violated the constitutional right of expression by making it mandatory for every establishment of more than 10 employees to have a name board in Marathi language in Devanagari script with a font size not less than that of any other language. The federation submitted that the state could not dictate its citizens in what language a signboard must be displayed as Article 14 and 19 give an unfettered right to every citizen to be the sole judge of mode and medium of expression.However, additional government pleader Abhay Patki for the state had argued that there was no contradiction in the rule and the Act and the true intent of the petitioners was not bonafide as the rule was in existence since 2018 but the petition was filed only in 2022.After hearing the submissions, the bench had noted in its order, “We do not find substance in any of these submissions whatsoever. There is a public purpose that is sought to be achieved by rule 35 if read correctly. We cannot divorce the operation of that rule from the sheer geographical ambit to which it applied i.e the state of Maharashtra. Marathi may be the official language of the state government but it is undeniably the mother tongue of the state.”While rejecting the petition, the HC also imposed a fine of ₹25,000 on the federation and deposit it in the CM relief fund within a week.Personalise your news feed.

While Virat, his plethora of fans and the entire Indian team will have plans on the special day, it seems as if birthday has come early for Kohli. A day before the former India captain turns 34, birthday wishes are storming in already for Kohli as Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell dropped a heart-warming message for Kohli on live TV.After Australia\\'s narrow four-run win over Afghanistan at the T20 World Cup, Maxwell was up for an interview with renowned sports broadcaster Neroli Meadows. It is important to note that despite Australia\\'s semi-final hopes depending on the outcome of the England vs Sri Lanka match, Maxwell appeared in good spirits when he wished his Royal Challengers Bangalore teammate Kohli in advance.\"Yeah, so tomorrow, I just want to wish a very happy birthday to one of my very good friends, Virat Kohli. Hope you have a great day. I\\'ll send you a text anyway. Enjoy, mate,\" said Maxwell.Watch the video below:pic.twitter.com/kMQq5fgBTKKohli and Maxwell have been teammates at RCB for two seasons. Maxwell joined RCB from Punjab Kings (formerly Kings XI Punjab) in 2021 after enduring a horror season with the 2014 IPL runner-up which saw him struggle and score just 108 runs from 14 matches. The following year, Maxwell hit top gear as he amassed 511 runs from 15 games at a strike-rate of 144.10, a season where he hit six half-centuries. At the IPL mega-auction, Maxwell was retained by RCB for ₹11 crore and scored 301 runs from 13 games in IPL 2022.Back to the Afghanistan game, Maxwell was adjudged the Player of the Match for his innings of 54 not out off 32 balls which lifted Australia to 168/8. An all-rounder in the team, Maxwell did not get to bowl but took a smart catch to dismiss Najibullah Zadran.\"It was nice to have an impact in the field. I knew I wasn\\'t going to have much of an impact with the ball with the conditions they were. To have an impact is nice. During the day, it was quite slow and taking spin, it was holding up a little bit,\" he added.While Maxwell praised Afghanistan for the fight their batters showed, he knows what is at stake on Saturday as England face Sri Lanka in the final Group 1 match. An England win will see them go through and join New Zealand in the semifinals, whereas for Australia to qualify for the semis, the already knocked out Sri Lanka need to beat Jos Buttler and his team. Maxwell, who found himself in a similar situation a few months back during the IPL, said he and the Aussies will be cheering the Lankans on in the crunch game in Sydney tomorrow.\"Afghanistan played really well, they struck the ball really cleanly. At the start, they put us under pressure in the powerplay. We were able to hold them back but then there was some pretty clean hitting towards the back end and gave us a bit of a scare,\" Maxwell said.\"It was quite hard to press the issue. We got to about the 12th over mark where we just had to put a total on the board to make sure we gave ourselves a chance of winning the game. Even though we were trying to go hard, they (Afghanistan) bowled extremely well in the last four overs. They executed their plans and it was hard to get away. We\\'ll be following it (England vs Sri Lanka), we put ourselves in this situation, but hopefully Sri Lanka can do the job for us.\"At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

Suryakumar was always capable of playing stunning innings, but it was during India\\'s tour of England back in June that SKY really came into his own when he struck a maiden T20I ton at the Oval. Although Suryakumar\\'s knock was unable to get India over the line, he had arrived; and for the next few series, the cricketing fraternity would witness the rise of the world\\'s best T20I batsman.Besides being the highest T20I run-getter of 2022, Suryakumar has set the ongoing T20 World Cup ablaze as well, scoring back-to-back half-centuries as India are inches away from securing a semi-final berth. With over 1200 runs from just 38 matches at an average of 40.30, Suryakumar has become a T20I sensation, and is not behind in ODIs either. Currently at the peak of his form, there is no reason why Suryakumar Yadav cannot break into the Indian Test side, which is exactly what former coach Ravi Shastri told one of the broadcasters during the World Cup.\"I think he is a three-format player. I know they don\\'t talk about him for Test cricket. Let me tell you. This guy can play Test cricket and he can surprise a few. Send him there at No. 5 and let him stir it up,\" Shastri said.Reacting to Shastri\\'s compliments, Suryakumar, who made his India debut during the former coach\\'s tenure, couldn\\'t stop smiling – it was ear-to-ear. After soaking in all the wonderful things Shastri had to say about the hottest player in Indian cricket at the moment, Surya\\'s mind harked back to early 2021, when Shastri had informed SKY that he would be playing his first match for Team India.A post shared by ICC (@icc)\"I still remember. He called me up. He was sitting by the poolside before I made my debut, and he said, \\'Jaa ke bindaas dena\\' (Go and enjoy yourself). I still remember that and I\\'m absolutely loving it,\" Suryakumar, who was standing next to Shastri mentioned, the video of which was uploaded on ICC\\'s Instagram handle. In fact, turns out it wasn\\'t just Surya who was thrilled by what Shastri had to say. Virat Kohli too showed his acceptance by liking the video.pic.twitter.com/GajQ8uqGaJThe former India head coach is affirmative in his assessment and feels that SKY should be given a chance in all three formats of the game. Suryakumar has earned the moniker of being a 360-degree player, a tag which the great AB de Villiers had made famous due to his unbelievable range and types of strokes. And given the array of shots Suryakumar puts on display, it is hard to disagree with Shastri.\"He can play all three formats of the game and the reason I say that is that he is different. You don’t get too many players who can hit spots the way he does. He hits it into unusual areas he gets into unusual positions and it is literally a challenge to the bowler as to where he can bowl. His great ability is to read what length the bowler is bowling, he anticipates early and he backs himself and very few players go out with that kind of mindset,\" Shastri was quoted as saying by the ICC website.\"He is lighting up this World Cup and he is playing shots which 10 years ago no one would have imagined. The way he used that pace and bounce in Perth. He sussed the conditions, and it suited his game and I think his eyes will light up every time he goes to play in Australia as there is pace, there is bounce, and he likes to use the pace and bounce. There will be a lot of youngsters wanting to emulate him. Just watching the way he moves and the areas he tries to hit...he is a proper 360 degree player.

Get features likeIs it even possible to keep the limelight and the discussions away from Virat Kohli. The answer is quite simple. No! Kohli is in the news when he is scoring heaps of runs. He is in the news when he is not. He is in the news for his unbelievable high energy in the practice session. He is again in the news when he decides to skip an optional session. He is grabbing the headlines with his brilliant fielding and he is doing the same when he is faking it. \\'Fake fielding\\' that\\'s the latest to keep Virat Kohli in the news. Of course, he is the current leading run-scorer of the T20 World Cup and was India\\'s top-scorer against Bangladesh but all that seems to have slightly taken the backstage after Bangladesh keeper-batter Nurus Hasan accused him of \\'fake fielding.\\'So what\\'s the story? In the second ball of the 7th over of the Bangladesh chase, India pacer Arshdeep Singh collected the ball in the deep and threw towards keeper Dinesh Karthik as Bangladesh openers Litton Das and Nazmul Hasan Shanto attempted a couple. In between all this, Kohli, who had no role in the action, gestured of collecting the ball and throwing it when the ball was not even near him. Kohli\\'s actions had no bearing on the Bangladesh pair as they completed the second run without any difficulty but according to Bangladesh and also former India opener Aakash Chopra, it doesn\\'t matter whether the batters were deceived or not. It is actually the attempt to do it, that\\'s what qualifies as \\'fake fielding.\\'What does the ‘fake fielding’ rule say? cricket\\'s law 41.5, pertaining to unfair play, says “…it is unfair for any fielder wilfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive or obstruct either batter after the striker has received the ball.”In easy words, if the umpires believe that the fielder has attempted to deceive batters by faking a dive or a throw or has made any other fielding gesture when the ball is not near him then they can slap the fielding team with five penalty runs.\"The basic premise of the law is that if the on-field umpire feels that you have tried to deceive the batters (by faking a throw or a dive or any other action when the ball is not near you) now whether they have been actually deceived or not doesn\\'t matter. It will result in five penalty runs. If that five penalty runs were given, the two that the Bangladesh pair ran, would have still have been counted, the ball would have been dead and Bangladesh would have gotten to choose who takes strike in the next ball. So the consequences are huge, the penalty for fake fielding is incredible.\"Now what happened in this case? The on-field umpire didn\\'t see. It completely went unnoticed. If no one has seen it then you can\\'t charge it. The law says that the umpires need to notice it and judge it. Maybe the third umpire, if it\\'s in jurisdiction, can also intervene.\"Woh fake fielding tha, 100% tha, wo jo throw marne ka prayas kia wo agar umpire dekhte toh 5 run ki pentaly padti humko aur 5 run se hum match bhi jeete. (Yes that 100% fake fielding because of the way he attempted to throw the ball. If the umpires had seen it then we would\\'ve been slapped with a five-run penalty and we\\'ve won by five runs only.) So we escaped here but next time if someone does this then the umpires will have to be more careful. So are Bangladesh right? Yes, they are but nobody noticed it then so can\\'t do anything now,\" Chopra said on his YouTube channel.At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

Every year, with the onset of the winter season, the toxic smog surrounds the capital and the NCR region which is replete with carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and other matter. The government has already issued notice for schools to close and for fifty percent employee attendance in government offices as steps for the air pollution. The pollution has several levels of affecting the human body. While some show impact in short term, some take long years to show up, and impact the body adversely. Children are affected more adversely on a daily basis, as they breathe in the toxic air. “Particles of a diameter of 10 microns or less are included in the PM10 measurement, which is typically used to assess the quality of the air. Due to their capacity to enter the lower parts of the respiratory system, these particles are thought to be the cause of harmful health effects,” said Dr. Ashutosh Niranjan M.B.B.S, M.S. (General Surgery), Dean of Noida International Institute of Medical Sciences.Speaking to HT Lifestyle, Dr Vikas Maurya - Director & HOD - Pulmonology, Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh added, “As per WHO, more than 90% of the world's children breathe toxic air every day which is a big statement. It shows that children under the age of 15 years breathe air that is so polluted that it puts their health and development at serious risk and many of them die as well.” He further shared insights on how air pollution can have long term effect on kids:ALSO READ: Delhi-NCR air pollution: How it's damaging your kidneys, know from expertLung growth: As kids are in their developing stage, pollution can affect their lung growth at an early stage and as their age increases, they become more prone to diseases like asthma.

Hence, they become prone to more infections and more immunity-related issues as they grow up.Dr Ashutosh Niranjan added, “Early learning, attention, and memory are significantly impacted because pollution has a negative impact on a child's health in those early years.

Get features likeThere is no evidence that reservation for women, scheduled castes and tribes in politics leads to massive incompetence, said Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee on Friday, adding that independent women legislators are emerging because of it.Delivering the 27th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture on the topic “Democracy on the Ground: What works, what doesn’t and why”, Banerjee countered the criticism that reservation is anti-merit. “While there are often claims that somehow this (reservation) will lead to massive incompetence, you see no evidence of it. What you see, over a period of time is independent women legislators emerging as a result of it.”“There is very compelling evidence that reservation, both for SC/ST and women, has had a salutary effect,” the Indian-origin American economist said.Also read: Goyal blames Delhi, Punjab’s AAP govts for pollution in national capitalHe added that these were the findings based on studies conducted by experts, including his wife Esther Duflo who has researched in this area,Both Banerjee and Duflo were named co-winners of the 2019 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel. The duo, who are professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge shared this honour with Harvard University economist Michael Kremer for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.On Friday, Banerjee also termed reservation as a “failure by design” in democracy.Due to reservation in local bodies, he said, “A lot of persons elected to local self-government bodies do not get a second run due to rotation of seats to accommodate reservation. So we want local democracy but we also want reservation. That’s a failure by design.”Banerjee said that an average constituency in India is quite big compared to electoral constituencies abroad. This impacts elections as voters hardly get information about their elected representatives and whatever little the elected leaders do, satisfies a small portion of the electorate.“If we want democracy to work, we should have smaller constituencies,” Banerjee said.Making a comparison, he said that Indian Lok Sabha has 540 seats while the British House of Commons has 650 Members of Parliament. The population here is 20 times that of the United Kingdom with each constituency being 24 times larger than those existing there, he noted.“When constituencies are large, it is hard to get information about legislators. Leaders on ground matter very little for individuals. We do not have a direct mechanism for rewarding legislators. Whatever they do, affects a little segment in their constituency. This breeds indifference among people. This ultimately impacts voting patterns,” he said.Sharing from his experimental work carried out in India, Banerjee explained that when voters are told about their legislators, it impacts their choices. In the absence of this information, he said, “Voters begin to think that ‘the system does not deliver much in any case, so why don’t I vote for my caste or someone who sounds similar to my name’....This is partly because they have no idea what their legislators do.”Sharing data from Uttar Pradesh for the years between 1980 and 1996, Banerjee said that as more people from a particular caste were elected, corruption among them rose.Also read: AAP govt to showcase ‘The City That Cares’ at Pragati Maidan fair“There is tolerance of people from your own caste of people who are corrupt. They say that they come from ‘their’ party. The more dominant (caste) that you are, the worse legislators you elect. This is the striking thing that ethno-centricity does. You are ethno-centric because you have no stake in politics.”He also touched upon other structural problems in education, health where the priority of elected leaders is different from that of voters. “How does one change the distribution of power within the system so that democracy can function within the system is a thought I leave you with,” he added.The lecture was given in honour of former Delhi high court judge, Justice Sunanda Bhandare who died at the age of 52 in 1994.

Get features likeAam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal on Friday named former TV news anchor and social activist Isudan Gadhvi as the party’s chief ministerial candidate for next month’s assembly elections in Gujarat, where the party is hoping to spring a surprise against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and push the Opposition Congress into third place.Delhi chief minister Kejriwal said 40-year-old Gadhvi, who is a national general secretary of the AAP, got 73% votes in a poll conducted by the party to select the CM candidate. “On the wish of the people of Gujarat, Gadhvi is being named AAP’s chief ministerial candidate,” Kejriwal said.Gadhvi was up against state party unit chief Gopal Italia, a key member of the Patidar community who was recently summoned by the National Women’s Commission for controversial comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Italia was on the dais when the announcement was made, and congratulated Gadhvi for being named the party’s CM face.Also read: AAP trying to set poll agenda as it looks to make impact in GujaratGadhvi said, if given an opportunity to become the chief minister, he will either deliver on his promises or else he would quit politics.“Have faith in me. I will keep working for the people of Gujarat,” Gadhvi, whose mother was also present when the announcement was made, said. While the BJP did not react to the development, the Congress said Gadhvi’s role is to cut the party’s votes in Gujarat.Recalling his meeting with Kejriwal before joining the AAP in 2021, Gadhvi said: “I was a successful journalist and had been raising issues of common people... When I met Arvind ji, he told me that to clean the mess, you need to enter it. It was then that I decided to join politics.”“Isudan hails from a small place near Khambhaliya town in Saurashtra where his family is engaged in farming. Like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gadhvi also belongs to the OBC (other backward classes) community. It will be interesting to see how his role as CM candidate plays out ,” said Satish Mori, channel head for Praveg TV.Mori first hired Gadhvi as a journalist for a news channel in Vapi after he completed his postgraduate diploma in journalism from Gujarat Vidyapith, Ahmedabad, in 2005. “The day he decided to quit journalism, he came and told me he is going to soon join politics,” Mori added.Gadhvi became known across Gujarat, thanks to Mahamanthan, a prime-time show he hosted between 2015 and 2021.He comes from a family of farmers in Dwarka district, and is from the OBC community, which accounts for 48% of the state’s population.Elections for the 182-member Gujarat assembly will be held in two phases on December 1 and 5. The results will be announced on December 8.Kejriwal said over 1.6 million people voted in the poll to select the CM candidate, of which 73% preferred Gadhvi. Last week, Kejriwal urged people to contact the party through SMS, WhatsApp, voice mail and e-mail to give their views about who should be the CM candidate from the party.“During the Punjab elections, we had asked people as to who should be the next chief minister. People named Bhagwant Mann by a huge majority. And as per the wishes of the public, we made him the chief minister,” Kejriwal said.State AAP chief Italia said Gadhvi had worked hard to reach his current position.Also read: Goyal blames Delhi, Punjab’s AAP govts for pollution in national capital“He is a capable person and I am sure that under his leadership, AAP will form the government in Gujarat,” he said.State Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi hit out at the AAP: “We are sure Gadhvi will try his best to carry the duties cut out for him. His role is very well defined and it is to ensure his party cuts maximum number of Congress votes. AAP is the B-team of BJP.”Gujarat BJP spokesperson Yamal Vyas declined to comment on the matter.Experts were apprehensive of the fallout of AAP’s decision. “The AAP has tried to score a point over Congress by declaring a CM candidate. I will not be surprised if some senior leaders quit over this decision...,” said Vidyut Joshi, former vice-chancellor of the Bhavnagar University, alluding to Gadhvi’s recent entry into politics.Personalise your news feed.

What surprised me was that every Bangladeshi in and outside the stadium chanted ‘Pakistan Zindabad’.\"Subscribe Now! Get features likePakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan on Friday drew parallels from 1970 when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman-led Awami League wasn't allowed to form the government despite winning the majority in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in the general elections.“What happened in East Pakistan? The largest party won, but they were not given the right. Instead, we took action against them,” said Khan drawing parallels between the 1971 liberation war and 2022 in Pakistan.“At the age of 18, I went to play an exhibition cricket match in Bangladesh. We won two matches against India. What surprised me was that every Bangladeshi in and outside the stadium chanted ‘Pakistan Zindabad’. That day, I realised the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan is the biggest tragedy,” Khan said in his first public remarks since the assassination attempt on him on Thursday.Khan was shot in the leg as he waved to crowds from a container mounted on a truck from where he was leading a protest march on the capital to press for early elections and calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.In erstwhile East Pakistan, a huge majority of the Bengali nation had favoured the Awami League, under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in the 1970 Pakistani general elections. The party had emerged as the largest party in the nation, gaining the exclusive mandate of Pakistan in terms both of seats and votes.The Pakistan Peoples Party failed to win any seats in East Pakistan. The Awami League's failure to win any seats in then west Pakistan was used by Zulfikar Bhutto who argued that Mujibur had received \"no mandate or support from West Pakistan\". The then leaders of Pakistan, all from West Pakistan and PPP, strongly opposed the idea of an East Pakistani-led government.Meanwhile, Khan said on Friday that he would resume his protest march to Islamabad after recovering even as his supporters staged nationwide protests that blocked major roads.He said two shooters had tried to assassinate him, in a country with a history of politically motivated violence. He said one person was killed and 11 others were injured in Thursday's attack in Wazirabad, about 170 km (106 miles) southeast of Islamabad.Khan also said the failed assassination attempt against him will push the people of Pakistan to take to the streets like in Sri Lanka.“Either we will have a peaceful revolution or a bloody one,” the former prime minister said, adding, “People will take to the streets like Sri Lanka.

Get features likeAmid his growing rift with the state government, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has written to President Droupadi Murmu alleging that he was not informed of a 10-day foreign trip taken by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the first week of October, people close to the Raj Bhavan said.It is customary for the chief minister to brief the Governor ahead of a foreign trip and then call on the head of the state upon return.The Governor has further alleged that he was unaware of the arrangements made to run the government while Vijayan was on the 10-day trip, said one of the people mentioned above, asking not to be named.Vijayan had travelled to Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom along with a contingent during the October trip and had stayed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for a few days before returning to the country.The CM’s office said Khan was informed about the trip when he visited Kannur to pay his respects to deceased Marxist leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on October 3.Also read: VIDEO | Six-year-old boy kicked in Kerala, BJP says 'Devil's own land'After his visit, the CM had held a press conference in the state capital on October 18 saying “it was a successful trip” aimed at boosting investment and cooperation with European countries.The governor wrote to President Murmu in the second week of October saying that he came to know about the trip through media reports, said the person mentioned above.Governor Khan further wrote that he was totally in the dark about the “long foreign trip of the CM and his entourage”, said another person, also asking not to be named.Ties between Khan and the state government have been deteriorating over the last two months.The uneasy relationship took a downward turn in August after the governor refused to sign 11 ordinances brought by the government, which was later forced to call a special session of the assembly to pass these legislations.Though Khan later signed a majority of the bills, he withheld his consent to two of them — one aiming to curtail powers of the Lokayukta and another to curtail the governor’s powers as the chancellor of universities.On Thursday, Khan had raised serious allegations against Vijayan saying his office was patronising smuggling activities in the state. He also rejected charges of interference in appointments in state’s universities levelled against him by the ruling front’s leaders. At a convention in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday, Vijayan and other LDF leaders attacked Khan alleging that he was trying to implement the agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in state universities.Also read: Man arrested in Kerala for allegedly assaulting minor boy for leaning on his carMeanwhile, activists belonging to the Students Federation of India (SFI) on Friday blocked the entry of acting vice- chancellor of APJ Abdul Kalam University Sisa Thomas, who was appointed by the Governor. Later, she entered the campus with police protection and a section of employees also protested against her.The appointment of an acting V-C was necessitated after the Supreme Court quashed the appointment of incumbent M S Rajashree last month for flouting norms of the University Grants Commission (UGC). Citing the apex court order, last month, the Governor had sent show-cause notices to 11 V-Cs saying their appointments also flouted UGC norms and they were not entitled to hold their offices in view of the judgment.Initially, the government recommended the name of Digital University V-C Saj Gopinath for the post but Khan turned it down as he was among the 11 V-Cs who were served show-cause notices.Later, the government proposed the name of higher education secretary Ishita Roy, a senior IAS officer, but this was also turned down citing a lack of experience or technical prowess.Personalise your news feed.

Get features likeMumbai: In a relief to the Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association (FRTWA), the Supreme Court (SC) has directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to maintain status quo on the issue of the rule mandating shops and establishments to display their names in Marathi.The FRTWA had approached the SC after their plea challenging the BMC’s decision on making Marathi signboards in Devnagri script mandatory was rejected by the high court (HC) in February this year. The BMC decision had further stated that shopkeepers failing to comply would be fined ₹1 lakh, which was also challenged by the federation. The SC has restrained the BMC from taking any action against retailers till the petition is decided in the SC.Speaking about the development, a FRTWA member said that apart from restraining the civic authority, the SC directed the federation to furnish a list of retailers who would be covered by the interim protection.The issue pertains to the challenge by the FRTWA to rule 35 of the Maharashtra Shops and Establishment Act, which stipulated that every commercial establishment signboard had to be in Marathi language in the Devanagari script along with any other language. The petition of FRTWA was heard by the HC division bench of justice Gautam Patel and justice Madhav Jamdar on February 23, 2022.The federation had submitted that the rule 35 was contrary to the Act and hence imposition of a penalty of ₹1 lakh for non-compliance was akin to putting an individual under a disability. The federation also submitted that the adoption of Marathi language by the state was only meant for official purposes and hence individuals could not be forced to accept the same.The bench was also informed that the rule violated the constitutional right of expression by making it mandatory for every establishment of more than 10 employees to have a name board in Marathi language in Devanagari script with a font size not less than that of any other language. The federation submitted that the state could not dictate its citizens in what language a signboard must be displayed as Article 14 and 19 give an unfettered right to every citizen to be the sole judge of mode and medium of expression.However, additional government pleader Abhay Patki for the state had argued that there was no contradiction in the rule and the Act and the true intent of the petitioners was not bonafide as the rule was in existence since 2018 but the petition was filed only in 2022.After hearing the submissions, the bench had noted in its order, “We do not find substance in any of these submissions whatsoever. There is a public purpose that is sought to be achieved by rule 35 if read correctly. We cannot divorce the operation of that rule from the sheer geographical ambit to which it applied i.e the state of Maharashtra. Marathi may be the official language of the state government but it is undeniably the mother tongue of the state.”While rejecting the petition, the HC also imposed a fine of ₹25,000 on the federation and deposit it in the CM relief fund within a week.Personalise your news feed.

The side defeated Netherlands and South Africa to keep its hopes alive for a semi-final qualification in the tournament, but their fate rests on other matches in their group in addition to their own. The blockbuster final match-day of Group 2 will see all the sides in action, and the day will end with two confirmed semi-finalists with four sides – Pakistan, India, South Africa, and Bangladesh – in contention for the next stage.In Pakistan, a number of former cricketers had expressed their disappointment with the side's poor start to the tournament, and even the current players – Wahab Riaz and Mohammad Amir – were critical of the side. Both pacers are currently out-of-favour with the current team management and are currently a part of the expert panel on a Pakistan national television channel.Also read: Watch - 'I'll send you a text anyway': Virat Kohli's birthday begins early with adorable message from Maxwell on live TVInterestingly, a fan, in another Pakistan channel, asked the country's legendary former fast bowler Wasim Akram on his advise to Wahab and Amir, who have “suddenly turned into experts.”“Wasim bhai, any word of advise for Amir and Wahab who have suddenly turned into TV cricket experts, hell bent on criticising left, right and centre?” a fan asked Akram on A Sports.Akram, however, had a rather straightforward reply. The former Pakistan captain insisted that both are mature enough but advised them to be “as positive as they can.”“I suppose, they are big boys. They know what they are doing.

Get features likeStar India batter Virat Kohli will celebrate his birthday tomorrow, i.e. – November 5. While Virat, his plethora of fans and the entire Indian team will have plans on the special day, it seems as if birthday has come early for Kohli. A day before the former India captain turns 34, birthday wishes are storming in already for Kohli as Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell dropped a heart-warming message for Kohli on live TV.After Australia's narrow four-run win over Afghanistan at the T20 World Cup, Maxwell was up for an interview with renowned sports broadcaster Neroli Meadows. It is important to note that despite Australia's semi-final hopes depending on the outcome of the England vs Sri Lanka match, Maxwell appeared in good spirits when he wished his Royal Challengers Bangalore teammate Kohli in advance.\"Yeah, so tomorrow, I just want to wish a very happy birthday to one of my very good friends, Virat Kohli. Hope you have a great day. I'll send you a text anyway. Enjoy, mate,\" said Maxwell.Watch the video below:pic.twitter.com/kMQq5fgBTKKohli and Maxwell have been teammates at RCB for two seasons. Maxwell joined RCB from Punjab Kings (formerly Kings XI Punjab) in 2021 after enduring a horror season with the 2014 IPL runner-up which saw him struggle and score just 108 runs from 14 matches. The following year, Maxwell hit top gear as he amassed 511 runs from 15 games at a strike-rate of 144.10, a season where he hit six half-centuries. At the IPL mega-auction, Maxwell was retained by RCB for ₹11 crore and scored 301 runs from 13 games in IPL 2022.Back to the Afghanistan game, Maxwell was adjudged the Player of the Match for his innings of 54 not out off 32 balls which lifted Australia to 168/8. An all-rounder in the team, Maxwell did not get to bowl but took a smart catch to dismiss Najibullah Zadran.\"It was nice to have an impact in the field. I knew I wasn't going to have much of an impact with the ball with the conditions they were. To have an impact is nice. During the day, it was quite slow and taking spin, it was holding up a little bit,\" he added.While Maxwell praised Afghanistan for the fight their batters showed, he knows what is at stake on Saturday as England face Sri Lanka in the final Group 1 match. An England win will see them go through and join New Zealand in the semifinals, whereas for Australia to qualify for the semis, the already knocked out Sri Lanka need to beat Jos Buttler and his team. Maxwell, who found himself in a similar situation a few months back during the IPL, said he and the Aussies will be cheering the Lankans on in the crunch game in Sydney tomorrow.\"Afghanistan played really well, they struck the ball really cleanly. At the start, they put us under pressure in the powerplay. We were able to hold them back but then there was some pretty clean hitting towards the back end and gave us a bit of a scare,\" Maxwell said.\"It was quite hard to press the issue. We got to about the 12th over mark where we just had to put a total on the board to make sure we gave ourselves a chance of winning the game. Even though we were trying to go hard, they (Afghanistan) bowled extremely well in the last four overs. They executed their plans and it was hard to get away. We'll be following it (England vs Sri Lanka), we put ourselves in this situation, but hopefully Sri Lanka can do the job for us.\"At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

       "      <th>Suryakumar Yadav's expressions were a thing of beauty after former coach Ravi Shastri backed the India batter to play all three formats. And to top it all, Virat Kohli dropped a golden reaction to it as well.Subscribe Now! Get features likeOver the last few months, Suryakumar Yadav has taken the world of cricket by putting up match-winning performances one match after the other. Suryakumar was always capable of playing stunning innings, but it was during India's tour of England back in June that SKY really came into his own when he struck a maiden T20I ton at the Oval. Although Suryakumar's knock was unable to get India over the line, he had arrived; and for the next few series, the cricketing fraternity would witness the rise of the world's best T20I batsman.Besides being the highest T20I run-getter of 2022, Suryakumar has set the ongoing T20 World Cup ablaze as well, scoring back-to-back half-centuries as India are inches away from securing a semi-final berth. With over 1200 runs from just 38 matches at an average of 40.30, Suryakumar has become a T20I sensation, and is not behind in ODIs either. Currently at the peak of his form, there is no reason why Suryakumar Yadav cannot break into the Indian Test side, which is exactly what former coach Ravi Shastri told one of the broadcasters during the World Cup.\"I think he is a three-format player. I know they don't talk about him for Test cricket. Let me tell you. This guy can play Test cricket and he can surprise a few. Send him there at No. 5 and let him stir it up,\" Shastri said.Reacting to Shastri's compliments, Suryakumar, who made his India debut during the former coach's tenure, couldn't stop smiling – it was ear-to-ear. After soaking in all the wonderful things Shastri had to say about the hottest player in Indian cricket at the moment, Surya's mind harked back to early 2021, when Shastri had informed SKY that he would be playing his first match for Team India.A post shared by ICC (@icc)\"I still remember. He called me up. He was sitting by the poolside before I made my debut, and he said, 'Jaa ke bindaas dena' (Go and enjoy yourself). I still remember that and I'm absolutely loving it,\" Suryakumar, who was standing next to Shastri mentioned, the video of which was uploaded on ICC's Instagram handle. In fact, turns out it wasn't just Surya who was thrilled by what Shastri had to say. Virat Kohli too showed his acceptance by liking the video.pic.twitter.com/GajQ8uqGaJThe former India head coach is affirmative in his assessment and feels that SKY should be given a chance in all three formats of the game. Suryakumar has earned the moniker of being a 360-degree player, a tag which the great AB de Villiers had made famous due to his unbelievable range and types of strokes. And given the array of shots Suryakumar puts on display, it is hard to disagree with Shastri.\"He can play all three formats of the game and the reason I say that is that he is different. You don’t get too many players who can hit spots the way he does. He hits it into unusual areas he gets into unusual positions and it is literally a challenge to the bowler as to where he can bowl. His great ability is to read what length the bowler is bowling, he anticipates early and he backs himself and very few players go out with that kind of mindset,\" Shastri was quoted as saying by the ICC website.\"He is lighting up this World Cup and he is playing shots which 10 years ago no one would have imagined. The way he used that pace and bounce in Perth. He sussed the conditions, and it suited his game and I think his eyes will light up every time he goes to play in Australia as there is pace, there is bounce, and he likes to use the pace and bounce. There will be a lot of youngsters wanting to emulate him. Just watching the way he moves and the areas he tries to hit...he is a proper 360 degree player. He is someone who can puncture any part of the ground.\"At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

       "      <th>According to Bangladesh and also former India opener Aakash Chopra, it doesn't matter whether Virat Kohli really managed to deceive the batters. It is actually his attempt to do it, that's what qualifies as 'fake fielding.'Subscribe Now! Get features likeIs it even possible to keep the limelight and the discussions away from Virat Kohli. The answer is quite simple. No! Kohli is in the news when he is scoring heaps of runs. He is in the news when he is not. He is in the news for his unbelievable high energy in the practice session. He is again in the news when he decides to skip an optional session. He is grabbing the headlines with his brilliant fielding and he is doing the same when he is faking it. 'Fake fielding' that's the latest to keep Virat Kohli in the news. Of course, he is the current leading run-scorer of the T20 World Cup and was India's top-scorer against Bangladesh but all that seems to have slightly taken the backstage after Bangladesh keeper-batter Nurus Hasan accused him of 'fake fielding.'So what's the story? In the second ball of the 7th over of the Bangladesh chase, India pacer Arshdeep Singh collected the ball in the deep and threw towards keeper Dinesh Karthik as Bangladesh openers Litton Das and Nazmul Hasan Shanto attempted a couple. In between all this, Kohli, who had no role in the action, gestured of collecting the ball and throwing it when the ball was not even near him. Kohli's actions had no bearing on the Bangladesh pair as they completed the second run without any difficulty but according to Bangladesh and also former India opener Aakash Chopra, it doesn't matter whether the batters were deceived or not. It is actually the attempt to do it, that's what qualifies as 'fake fielding.'What does the ‘fake fielding’ rule say? cricket's law 41.5, pertaining to unfair play, says “…it is unfair for any fielder wilfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive or obstruct either batter after the striker has received the ball.”In easy words, if the umpires believe that the fielder has attempted to deceive batters by faking a dive or a throw or has made any other fielding gesture when the ball is not near him then they can slap the fielding team with five penalty runs.\"The basic premise of the law is that if the on-field umpire feels that you have tried to deceive the batters (by faking a throw or a dive or any other action when the ball is not near you) now whether they have been actually deceived or not doesn't matter. It will result in five penalty runs. If that five penalty runs were given, the two that the Bangladesh pair ran, would have still have been counted, the ball would have been dead and Bangladesh would have gotten to choose who takes strike in the next ball. So the consequences are huge, the penalty for fake fielding is incredible.\"Now what happened in this case? The on-field umpire didn't see. It completely went unnoticed. If no one has seen it then you can't charge it. The law says that the umpires need to notice it and judge it. Maybe the third umpire, if it's in jurisdiction, can also intervene.\"Woh fake fielding tha, 100% tha, wo jo throw marne ka prayas kia wo agar umpire dekhte toh 5 run ki pentaly padti humko aur 5 run se hum match bhi jeete. (Yes that 100% fake fielding because of the way he attempted to throw the ball. If the umpires had seen it then we would've been slapped with a five-run penalty and we've won by five runs only.) So we escaped here but next time if someone does this then the umpires will have to be more careful. So are Bangladesh right? Yes, they are but nobody noticed it then so can't do anything now,\" Chopra said on his YouTube channel.At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

Kohli has been in brilliant form at the ongoing T20 World Cup so far, scoring 220 runs in four matches including three unbeaten half-centuries. Kohli's innings against Pakistan in the side's opening game of this year's edition was widely regarded as one of the greatest in T20I history, and the batter himself rated it as the best innings he played in the shortest format.On Friday, it was Pakistan's Shahnawaz Dahani who took to his official Twitter profile to send his birthday wishes across to the ‘GOAT’, adding that he couldn't wait for November 5 (Kohli's birthday) and tweeted the wish in advance.Also read: 'Aap khud cricketer hain, ye lafz sahi nahi hai': Ex-Pakistan stars in heated argument over 'Rizwan ne harwaaya' remark“Just couldn't wait for 5th Nov to wish the artist who made cricket the most beautiful.

During a programme on Pakistan's GEO Super, the anchor talked about Suryakumar Yadav's ascension to the no.1 spot in the ICC T20I batting rankings, to which Sikander made a rather straightforward remark about Rizwan, who was previously at the top position.“Vo (Suryakumar Yadav) no.1 hai duniya me.

I'm just talking about the quality of players),” Sikander said.To this, former Pakistan wicketkeeper Moin Khan, who was also the part of the expert panel, made a strong remark on Sikander's ‘choice of words’.“Ek word ki toh correction karein, koi jaan-boojh ke nahi harwaata. Aadmi try karta hai. Aap khud cricketer hain. Harwaaya nahi hai, ye lafz sahi nahi hai aapka. (You should correct your word, no one deliberately wants to lose. Players try, you have been a cricketer yourself. He didn't make us lose, the word is not correct),” said Moin.Sikander, then, clarified his remark. “Jab chase shuru kiya, uss waqt average (run rate) 8 ki thi. Unhone 16 over khele, toh 18 ka average karke chale gaye. (When he started the chase, our required run rate was 8. When he was dismissed in the 16th over, it had towered up to 18rpo),” said the former Pakistan cricketer.At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

Get features likeThe Delhi-NCR region has started to suffer with the air pollution problems. Every year, with the onset of the winter season, the toxic smog surrounds the capital and the NCR region which is replete with carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and other matter. The government has already issued notice for schools to close and for fifty percent employee attendance in government offices as steps for the air pollution. The pollution has several levels of affecting the human body. While some show impact in short term, some take long years to show up, and impact the body adversely. Children are affected more adversely on a daily basis, as they breathe in the toxic air. “Particles of a diameter of 10 microns or less are included in the PM10 measurement, which is typically used to assess the quality of the air. Due to their capacity to enter the lower parts of the respiratory system, these particles are thought to be the cause of harmful health effects,” said Dr. Ashutosh Niranjan M.B.B.S, M.S. (General Surgery), Dean of Noida International Institute of Medical Sciences.Speaking to HT Lifestyle, Dr Vikas Maurya - Director &amp; HOD - Pulmonology, Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh added, “As per WHO, more than 90% of the world's children breathe toxic air every day which is a big statement. It shows that children under the age of 15 years breathe air that is so polluted that it puts their health and development at serious risk and many of them die as well.” He further shared insights on how air pollution can have long term effect on kids:ALSO READ: Delhi-NCR air pollution: How it's damaging your kidneys, know from expertLung growth: As kids are in their developing stage, pollution can affect their lung growth at an early stage and as their age increases, they become more prone to diseases like asthma. In their later stages, they can also have respiratory tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, upper respiratory tract infections, and pneumonia as well.Lung cancer: Lung cancer can also be seen in these children who are persistently exposed to pollution, pollutants, and harmful gases.Cardiovascular effects: It has also been found that apart from organs like lungs, it can also have cardiovascular effects, such as high blood pressure or other heart-related ailments.Immunity: Air pollution can also affect their immune system. Hence, they become prone to more infections and more immunity-related issues as they grow up.Dr Ashutosh Niranjan added, “Early learning, attention, and memory are significantly impacted because pollution has a negative impact on a child's health in those early years. This causes a rise in school absences, low academic performance, and eventually stunts social and economic development.”Personalise your news feed. Follow trending topics</th>\n",

       "      <th>There is no evidence that reservation for women, scheduled castes and tribes in politics leads to massive incompetence, said Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee on Friday, adding that independent women legislators are emerging because of it.Subscribe Now! Get features likeThere is no evidence that reservation for women, scheduled castes and tribes in politics leads to massive incompetence, said Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee on Friday, adding that independent women legislators are emerging because of it.Delivering the 27th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture on the topic “Democracy on the Ground: What works, what doesn’t and why”, Banerjee countered the criticism that reservation is anti-merit. “While there are often claims that somehow this (reservation) will lead to massive incompetence, you see no evidence of it. What you see, over a period of time is independent women legislators emerging as a result of it.”“There is very compelling evidence that reservation, both for SC/ST and women, has had a salutary effect,” the Indian-origin American economist said.Also read: Goyal blames Delhi, Punjab’s AAP govts for pollution in national capitalHe added that these were the findings based on studies conducted by experts, including his wife Esther Duflo who has researched in this area,Both Banerjee and Duflo were named co-winners of the 2019 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel. The duo, who are professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge shared this honour with Harvard University economist Michael Kremer for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.On Friday, Banerjee also termed reservation as a “failure by design” in democracy.Due to reservation in local bodies, he said, “A lot of persons elected to local self-government bodies do not get a second run due to rotation of seats to accommodate reservation. So we want local democracy but we also want reservation. That’s a failure by design.”Banerjee said that an average constituency in India is quite big compared to electoral constituencies abroad. This impacts elections as voters hardly get information about their elected representatives and whatever little the elected leaders do, satisfies a small portion of the electorate.“If we want democracy to work, we should have smaller constituencies,” Banerjee said.Making a comparison, he said that Indian Lok Sabha has 540 seats while the British House of Commons has 650 Members of Parliament. The population here is 20 times that of the United Kingdom with each constituency being 24 times larger than those existing there, he noted.“When constituencies are large, it is hard to get information about legislators. Leaders on ground matter very little for individuals. We do not have a direct mechanism for rewarding legislators. Whatever they do, affects a little segment in their constituency. This breeds indifference among people. This ultimately impacts voting patterns,” he said.Sharing from his experimental work carried out in India, Banerjee explained that when voters are told about their legislators, it impacts their choices. In the absence of this information, he said, “Voters begin to think that ‘the system does not deliver much in any case, so why don’t I vote for my caste or someone who sounds similar to my name’....This is partly because they have no idea what their legislators do.”Sharing data from Uttar Pradesh for the years between 1980 and 1996, Banerjee said that as more people from a particular caste were elected, corruption among them rose.Also read: AAP govt to showcase ‘The City That Cares’ at Pragati Maidan fair“There is tolerance of people from your own caste of people who are corrupt. They say that they come from ‘their’ party. The more dominant (caste) that you are, the worse legislators you elect. This is the striking thing that ethno-centricity does. You are ethno-centric because you have no stake in politics.”He also touched upon other structural problems in education, health where the priority of elected leaders is different from that of voters. “How does one change the distribution of power within the system so that democracy can function within the system is a thought I leave you with,” he added.The lecture was given in honour of former Delhi high court judge, Justice Sunanda Bhandare who died at the age of 52 in 1994. The event was presided by Supreme Court judge, justice Hima Kohli and attended by justice Sidharth Mridul of the Delhi high court and former Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan B Lokur.The gathering, comprising mostly of former judges, academicians, social workers and legal luminaries, observed a minute’s silence to remember another champion of women’s rights and SEWA founder Elaben Bhatt who passed away on November 2.Personalise your news feed.

Get features likeAam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal on Friday named former TV news anchor and social activist Isudan Gadhvi as the party’s chief ministerial candidate for next month’s assembly elections in Gujarat, where the party is hoping to spring a surprise against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and push the Opposition Congress into third place.Delhi chief minister Kejriwal said 40-year-old Gadhvi, who is a national general secretary of the AAP, got 73% votes in a poll conducted by the party to select the CM candidate. “On the wish of the people of Gujarat, Gadhvi is being named AAP’s chief ministerial candidate,” Kejriwal said.Gadhvi was up against state party unit chief Gopal Italia, a key member of the Patidar community who was recently summoned by the National Women’s Commission for controversial comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Italia was on the dais when the announcement was made, and congratulated Gadhvi for being named the party’s CM face.Also read: AAP trying to set poll agenda as it looks to make impact in GujaratGadhvi said, if given an opportunity to become the chief minister, he will either deliver on his promises or else he would quit politics.“Have faith in me. I will keep working for the people of Gujarat,” Gadhvi, whose mother was also present when the announcement was made, said. While the BJP did not react to the development, the Congress said Gadhvi’s role is to cut the party’s votes in Gujarat.Recalling his meeting with Kejriwal before joining the AAP in 2021, Gadhvi said: “I was a successful journalist and had been raising issues of common people... When I met Arvind ji, he told me that to clean the mess, you need to enter it. It was then that I decided to join politics.”“Isudan hails from a small place near Khambhaliya town in Saurashtra where his family is engaged in farming. Like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gadhvi also belongs to the OBC (other backward classes) community. It will be interesting to see how his role as CM candidate plays out ,” said Satish Mori, channel head for Praveg TV.Mori first hired Gadhvi as a journalist for a news channel in Vapi after he completed his postgraduate diploma in journalism from Gujarat Vidyapith, Ahmedabad, in 2005. “The day he decided to quit journalism, he came and told me he is going to soon join politics,” Mori added.Gadhvi became known across Gujarat, thanks to Mahamanthan, a prime-time show he hosted between 2015 and 2021.He comes from a family of farmers in Dwarka district, and is from the OBC community, which accounts for 48% of the state’s population.Elections for the 182-member Gujarat assembly will be held in two phases on December 1 and 5. The results will be announced on December 8.Kejriwal said over 1.6 million people voted in the poll to select the CM candidate, of which 73% preferred Gadhvi. Last week, Kejriwal urged people to contact the party through SMS, WhatsApp, voice mail and e-mail to give their views about who should be the CM candidate from the party.“During the Punjab elections, we had asked people as to who should be the next chief minister. People named Bhagwant Mann by a huge majority. And as per the wishes of the public, we made him the chief minister,” Kejriwal said.State AAP chief Italia said Gadhvi had worked hard to reach his current position.Also read: Goyal blames Delhi, Punjab’s AAP govts for pollution in national capital“He is a capable person and I am sure that under his leadership, AAP will form the government in Gujarat,” he said.State Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi hit out at the AAP: “We are sure Gadhvi will try his best to carry the duties cut out for him. His role is very well defined and it is to ensure his party cuts maximum number of Congress votes. AAP is the B-team of BJP.”Gujarat BJP spokesperson Yamal Vyas declined to comment on the matter.Experts were apprehensive of the fallout of AAP’s decision. “The AAP has tried to score a point over Congress by declaring a CM candidate. I will not be surprised if some senior leaders quit over this decision...,” said Vidyut Joshi, former vice-chancellor of the Bhavnagar University, alluding to Gadhvi’s recent entry into politics.Personalise your news feed.
